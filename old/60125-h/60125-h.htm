<div><h1 class='nobreak' id='ch1'>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<h3>Flags and Pedigree</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“I</span> have</span> finished work for the week. I’ll see no
one else were he as terse as Tacitus,” cried Mr.
Ferguson, the lawyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was six o’clock on a Friday afternoon
and a pleasant rustle of the plane trees in the square
came through the open window of the office. Mr. Ferguson
thought of his cool garden at Goring, with the
river running past, and of the fine long day he would
have upon the links to-morrow. Gregory, the head clerk,
however, held his ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps if you would look at this card, Mr. Ferguson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson looked at the size of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the Lord, no! It’s a woman. She’ll be as
prolix as the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not a woman,” the stubborn Gregory insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it’s a foreigner, and that’s worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not even a real foreigner,” said Gregory. He
had been a servant of the firm for thirty years, and
knew the ins and outs of its affairs as thoroughly as
the principals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very annoying, Gregory,” said Mr. Ferguson,
with a sigh. He took the card regretfully, but
when he had read the name printed upon it, he dropped
it upon his table as if it had stung his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul Ravenel!” he said in a low voice, with a glance
towards the door. “The son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he like the father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson was distressed. It was nine years
since he had finished with that affair, settled it up,
locked it away and turned his back on it for good—as
he thought. And here was the son knocking on his
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must see him, I suppose. I can do no less,” he
said, but as Gregory turned towards the door he stopped
him. “Why should Paul Ravenel come to see me?”
he asked himself. “And how much does he know?
Wait a moment, Gregory. I have got to go warily
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down at his desk. Mr. Ferguson was a man,
of middle age, with a round, genial face and a thick
covering of silver-white hair. He looked like a prosperous
country gentleman, which he was, and he had
the reputation of the astutest criminal lawyer of his
day. He was that, too. His kindly manner concealed
him, yet he was not false. For he was at once the best
of friends, with his vast experience of the law as a sort
of zareeba for their refuge, and the most patient and relentless
of antagonists; and he had a special kindliness
which showed itself conspicuously in his accounts, for
all connected with the arts. It was an old friendship
which was troubling him now as he sat at his desk.
Paul Ravenel, according to his knowledge, would take
this or that line in the interview, Mr. Ferguson must
be clear as to how in each case he should answer.
Problems were his daily food—at least until six o’clock
on Friday evening. Yet this problem he met with discomfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can show him in now,” he said to Gregory,
and a few seconds later the visitor stood within the
room, a tall slim youth, brown of face and with hair
so golden that the sun seemed to have taken from it
the colour which it had tanned upon his cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wish to see me, Mr. Ravenel?” he asked, and
a smile suddenly broke upon the boy’s face and made
him winning. Mr. Ferguson made a note in his mind
of the smile, for he had not as yet its explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Paul. “I should have been more
correct in approaching so prominent a firm, had I
written asking for an appointment. But I only landed
in England this morning, and I couldn’t really wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His formal little prepared apology broke down in a
laugh and an eager rush of words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said Mr. Ferguson pleasantly.
“Take a chair and tell me what I can do for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew my father,” said Paul, when he had laid
down his hat and stick and taken his seat. Mr. Ferguson
allowed himself a sharp glance at the lad. For his
tone was without any embarrassment at all, any shame
or embarrassment. He was at his ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew Mr. Ravenel—yes,” Mr. Ferguson answered
cautiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died a fortnight ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was sorry to notice that you were wearing black.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He died in a house which he had built upon an
island off the coast of Spain at Aguilas. I lived with
him there, during the last eight months, after I left my
school at Tours,” Paul continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father and I were always—how shall I put it?—in
a relationship which precluded any confidences and
even any cordiality. It wasn’t that we ever quarrelled.
We hardly were well enough acquainted for that. But
we were uncomfortable in each other’s company and
the end of a meal at which we had sat together was to
both of us an invariable relief. He had what I think
is a special quality of soldiers—he was in the Army,
of course, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul broke off to ask his question in the most casual
manner. But Mr. Ferguson did not answer it. It was
a neat little trap prepared with more skill than the
lawyer had expected. For up till the question was unconcernedly
dropped in, Paul had been framing his
sentences with a sort of pedantry natural to a man
who from the nature of his life must get his English
words from books rather than from conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say Monsieur Ravenel had some special quality
of soldiers,” Mr. Ferguson observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Paul explained. “I approached a subject, or
I used a phrase, and suddenly it seemed as if an iron
door was banged in my face, and he was now behind
the door, and not the loudest knocking in the world
would ever get it open. So I have come to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For information your father did not see fit to give
you?” said Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Monsieur Ravenel had no doubt a lawyer in
Paris and an agent in Casablanca, where he lived for
many years, both of whom will be familiar with his
affairs. Why come to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it is not about his affairs that I am seeking
information,” said Paul, and he took a letter from his
pocket-case and handed it to Mr. Ferguson. “This
was written by your firm, Mr. Ferguson. It is one of
the two clues to my father’s history which he left behind
him. It slipped out of a book upon his shelf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly the letter was written by our firm to your
father, Mr. Ravenel. But it was the last letter we
wrote to him. It closed our connection with him. We
never heard from him again; and the letter is as you
have seen, nine years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” said Paul. “Just about that time my father
and I were in London together for a couple of months,
and when I found that letter it seemed to me to explain
why. My father was in London to arrange for
the transfer of his property to France, for the final
annihilation of all his interests and associations with
this country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an assertion rather than a question, but Mr.
Ferguson answered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I suppose that you may put it that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before that time, then, you were his advisers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s why I came to you, Mr. Ferguson,” cried
the youth eagerly. “I want to know what happened to
my father in the days when you were his advisers. I
want to know why he renounced his own country,
why he buried himself first in a little distant town on
the sea coast of Morocco like Casablanca, why he took
refuge afterwards in a still closer seclusion at Aguilas
in Spain. You know! You must know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson rose from his desk and walked to the
fireplace which was between his desk and the chair on
which Paul was seated. He was puzzled by the manner
of the appeal. There was more eagerness than
anxiety in it. There was certainly no fear. There
was even confidence. Mr. Ferguson wondered whether
young Ravenel had some explanation of his own, an
explanation which quite satisfied him and which he
only needed to have confirmed. Paul’s voice broke in
upon his wondering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I can always find out. It’s only a question
of knowing the ropes. I have no doubt a good
enquiry agent could get me the truth in a very few days
if I went to one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson lifted himself on his toes and looked
up to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I should do that,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether I do or not depends upon you, Mr. Ferguson,”
said Paul, very quietly. “It’s not curiosity
that’s driving me, but I have my life in front of me,
and a plan for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and stood at the open window for a moment
or two, and then turned abruptly back and stood before
Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, I was nine years old when I was with
my father in London, old enough to notice, and old
enough to remember. And one or two very curious
things happened. We were in lodgings in a little quiet
street, and except on occasions when, I suppose, he
had appointments with you, my father never went out
by daylight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it comes,” thought Mr. Ferguson, but his
face was quite without expression, and the youth resumed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as soon as darkness fell we took long tramps
through the city, where the streets were empty of
everything but the lamp-posts, and the only sounds
were the hollow sounds of our own footsteps upon the
pavement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Mr. Ferguson interrupted. “One couldn’t
choose a better place for exercise than the city of
London after dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul laughed pleasantly and Mr. Ferguson reflected,
“I have never been called a liar in a prettier fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On one of these nightly rambles,” Paul resumed,
“we turned into a street closed at one end by a stately
building of pinnacles and a sloping roof, and windows
of richly stained glass. This building was a blaze of
light, and in the courtyard in front of it motor-cars
and carriages were taking up ladies in bright evening
frocks and coats and men with orders upon their
breasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A dinner at the Guildhall, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was curious to come suddenly out of darkness
and silence and emptiness,” Paul Ravenel resumed,
“into this gay scene of colour and enjoyment and light.
You can imagine how it impressed a child. This was
what I wanted. I hated long, empty, echoing streets
with chains of lamps stretching ahead. Here I heard
to me a sound unknown and divine—I heard women
laughing. ‘Oh, father, do let us stay for a moment
and look!’ I cried, but my father gripped me by the
arm, and strode across the road so swiftly that I had
to run to keep up with him. There was the mouth of
another street nearly opposite, and it was that street
which my father wanted to reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But a man was walking with a limp from the building
along the pavement on the far side of our road.
It was a hot night, and he carried his overcoat upon
his arm, and I saw that a conspicuous row of miniature
medals with their coloured ribbons stretched
across his left breast. We reached the kerb when he
was only a few yards from us. I felt my father’s
hand tremble suddenly upon my arm. I thought that
he was on the point of turning away in flight. But
since that would have been more noticeable, he just
dropped his head so that the brim of his hat shadowed
his face and strode swiftly past the man with the
medals. That man only gave us a careless glance, and
I heard my father draw a sigh of relief. But a few
paces on the man with the medals stopped and looked
back. Then he called out: ‘Ned! Ned!’ in a startled
voice, and began to retrace, as fast as his limp would
allow him, his steps towards us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father whispered to me: ‘Take no notice, boy!
Walk straight on,’ and in a moment dived into the
silence of the street opposite. I turned my head after
we had travelled a few yards in our new direction and
I saw the man with the medals at the angle of the
street peering after us as if he were undecided
whether to follow us or not. There the incident ended,
but it was—well—significant, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson was distinctly uncomfortable. A pair
of very steady and watchful grey eyes were fixed upon
his. He was being cross-examined and not clumsily,
and by a boy; and all of this he fretfully resented. To
do the cross-examining was his function in life, not
the other fellow’s. Besides, how was he to answer
that word significant? Such a good word! For it
opened no glimpses of the questioner’s point of view
and was a trap for the questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it significant?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul suddenly smiled, and Mr. Ferguson was more
perplexed than ever. The boy was not obtuse—that
was clear. It was no less clear, then, that he attached
some quite special significance of his own invention to
the incident he had related. Monsieur Ravenel was in
hiding—that’s what the incident signified. How had
Paul missed it? What strange amulet was he wearing
that saved him from the desolating truth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever read ‘Balaustion’s Adventure’?” Paul
inquired, and Mr. Ferguson jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you wouldn’t spring from one subject to
another like that,” he answered, testily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am on the same subject,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, I did. I used it as a crib for the Alcestis
when I was at school.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pretty good crib, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the translation of the Alcestis isn’t the whole
of the poem, is it? The Alcestis makes things pretty
black for Admetus, doesn’t it? You’d call him a bit
of a rotter, wouldn’t you? That is, if you take the
first surface meaning of the play. But Balaustion
found another meaning underneath which transfigures
Admetus, turns the black to white. Well, humbly, but
just as confidently, I look underneath the first obvious
meaning of what I told you. That’s disgrace, isn’t it?
Let’s be frank about it! A man in disgrace shunning
his friends! There’s the surface reading. And there’s
no other—except mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hear it,” said Mr. Ferguson quickly. He
returned to the chair at his table. Here might be, after
all, a pleasant way out of this disconcerting interview.
“Will you smoke?” he asked, and he held out a tin of
cigarettes to his visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now fire away!” he said. Mr. Ferguson was in a
much more cheerful mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Discomfort, however, had not vanished from the
room. It had passed from Mr. Ferguson. But it had
entered into Paul. He stammered and was shy. Finally
he blurted out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find the explanation of everything in my father’s
passionate love for my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson’s eyes turned slowly from the plane
trees to Paul’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you go on, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother was French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Virginia Ravenel. She sang for one season
at Covent Garden. She was the most beautiful girl I
ever saw in my life.” He laughed, tenderly caressing
his recollections. “There was a time when I fancied
myself your father’s rival. You have a look of her,
Mr. Ravenel. She was fair like you,” and he was still
musing with pleasure and just a touch of regret upon
the pangs and ardours of that long-vanished season
of summer and magic, when Paul Ravenel thoroughly
startled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that my mother died in giving me birth,”
he said. “That’s how I explain to myself my father’s
distance and uneasiness with me. I was the enemy,
and worse than that, the enemy who had won. No
wonder he couldn’t endure me, if with her death his
whole world went dark. And everything else follows,
doesn’t it? His friends came to mean—not nothing
at all, but an actual annoyance, an encroachment on
his grief. He shut himself up far away in a little town
where no one knew him, and brooded over his loss.
And men who do that become extravagant, don’t they,
and lose their perspective, and do far-fetched, unreasonable
things. Thus, my mother was French. So in
a sort of distorted tribute to her memory, he changed
his own nationality and took hers, and with it her
name, and cut himself completely off from all his old
world—a sort of monk of Love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson listened to the boy’s speech, which
was delivered with a good deal of hesitation, without
changing a muscle of his face. So this was why Paul
could elate with a laugh the flight from the man with
the medals and the lighted courtyard of the Guildhall.
This was what he believed! Well, it was the explanation
which a boy ignorant of life, nursed by dreams
and poetry and loneliness and eager to believe the world
a place of sunlight and high thoughts, might easily
have conceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that the explanation, Mr. Ferguson?” Paul
asked; and Mr. Ferguson replied without the twitch
of a muscle:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely! I did not think that you could have
understood your father’s reticence so thoroughly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one must do a thing, to do it with an air is
the best way to carry conviction, thought Mr. Ferguson,
and he rose from his chair with a deep relief.
The interview was over, his visitor obviously satisfied,
he could shake him by the hand and after all catch his
train to Goring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson’s relief, however, was premature.
For the younger man cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! For now the way is clear for me, and I can
ask you for your professional help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said the lawyer doubtfully. “I didn’t understand
that you came as a client. I am not very sure
that we can undertake much more than we have upon
our hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not so much more, Mr. Ferguson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be the judge of that. Let me hear what it
is that you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to resume my own real nationality,” said
Paul. “I am of my race. I want the name of it, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul was of his race. It was not merely the long-legged
build of him, nor the cut of his clothes, nor the
make of his shoes, but a whole combination of small,
indefinable qualities and movements and repressions
which proved it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should never have mistaken him for anything
else,” thought Mr. Ferguson. There was that little
speech, for instance, about his father’s love for his
mother, halting, shy, stammered, as if he were more
than half ashamed of admitting the emotions to another
man, and tongue-tied in consequence. The
words would have run glibly enough had a French lad
spoken them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And with my race, I mean of course also to resume
my father’s name,” Paul continued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had suddenly grown up an antagonism between
these two people; and both were aware of it.
Paul’s questions became a little implacable; Mr. Ferguson’s
silence a little obstinate. “You know it, of
course, Mr. Ferguson,” Paul insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” replied Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell it to me, please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father never told you it. Your father was
my client for years, my friend for many more. I respect
his wishes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel bowed and accepted the refusal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have only one more question to ask of you, Mr.
Ferguson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will answer it if I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you! Who is John Edward Revel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul bowed again. He took up his hat and his stick.
He was not smiling any more, and in his eyes there
was a look of apprehension. He did not hold out his
hand to Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will have to be the enquiry agent after all, then,”
he said. “Good evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lawyer allowed him to reach the door, and then
spoke in an altered voice. There was a warm kindliness
in it now, and to the youth’s anxious and attentive
ears a very audible note of commiseration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ravenel, I want you to give me four days before
you set on foot any inquiry. There are others
concerned in the matter. I assure you that you will be
wise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shook his head. “Four days. What shall I do
with myself during those four days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been very lonely for years,” said the
lawyer gently. “Four days more, what do they
mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During those years,” answered Paul, “I have had
the future for my companion. Have I got that companion
now?” and Mr. Ferguson was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to your office full of expectation. I have
not even now revealed to you the plan I had formed,”
Paul resumed. “I leave it a prey to a very deep anxiety.
That name I mentioned to you, I found written
on the flyleaf of an old manual on infantry drill in
my father’s bedroom. It was the only old book on his
shelf from which the flyleaf had not been torn out. I
am only now beginning to grasp what that may mean.”
But since Mr. Ferguson had ceased to dispute or pretend,
and showed openly a face where distress was
joined with good will, the young man cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, I’ll give you the four days, Mr. Ferguson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote down the name of his hotel upon a slip of
paper and left it on the desk, and shook the lawyer by
the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left alone, Mr. Ferguson sat for a little while in a
muse, living again the sweet and bitter scenes of vanished
years. To what unhappy ends of death and disgrace
had those anxieties and endeavours led? To
what futilities the buoyant aspiration? He rang the
bell upon his desk, and when his head clerk appeared
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want a message telephoned to Goring that I shall
not get home until eight. Then every one can go. I
have a letter to write which will take a little time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, sir,” said Gregory, and Mr. Ferguson
suddenly slapped his hand down on the table in exasperation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a curious thing, Gregory?” he exclaimed.
“Here’s a man takes a world of pains to destroy all
traces and records and then keeps by him one book
with a name written upon the flyleaf which brings in a
second all his trouble to nothing! But it’s always the
way. Something’s forgotten which you’d think no
man in his senses would overlook! Half the miseries
in the world I do believe come from such omissions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And more than half our business,” Gregory replied
drily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ferguson broke into a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s true, Gregory,” he cried. “And now
leave me to my letter!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He worded his letter with infinite care, for it was as
delicate a piece of work as he had ever been called
upon to do, and it took him a full hour. He posted it
himself in a pillar-box on his way to Paddington.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch2'>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<h3>The Man with the Medals</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hough Paul</span> left Mr. Ferguson’s office with
a calm enough face, his mind was bewildered
and fear clutched at his heart. Things were
happening to him which he had never imagined at all.
He had been confident with all the perfect confidence
of eighteen years and his confidence in a second was
gone. He was in real distress, which made him ache
like some physical hurt and tortured him at night so
that he could not sleep till long after daybreak. He
could not adjust himself to the new conditions of his
life. He looked with surprise upon other people, in
the streets or in the public rooms of his hotel, who were
unaware of the troubles which had hold of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had planned his visit to London full with many
a pilgrimage. The London of Dickens and De Quincey—its
inns, its gardens and churches! That old mansion
at the northwest corner of Greek Street, where
Mr. Brunell had given a lodging and a bundle of law
papers for a pillow, to his youthful client—all were
to be visited with a thrill of excitement and a hope that
they would not fall short of the images he had made
of them in his thoughts. But the glamour had faded
from all these designs. He paced the streets, and indeed
all day, but it was to get through the long dismal
hours and he walked like one in a maze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew no one and throughout the four days no
one spoke to him at all. He moved through the
crowded thoroughfares unnoticed as a wraith; he sat
apart in restaurants; and as his father had done, he
tramped by night the hollow-sounding streets of the
city where the lamp-posts kept their sentry guard. On
the fifth day, however, the expected letter did come by
the first post from Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will travel to Pulburo’ in Sussex by the 3.55
<span class='sc'>P. M.</span> train from Victoria on the day you receive this,
Colonel Vanderfelt will send a car to meet you at the
station and will put you up for the night. Will you
please send a telegram to him”; and the Colonel’s address
followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul sent off his telegram at once and followed it in
the afternoon. Outside Pulboro’ station a small grey
car was waiting and a girl of his own age, with brown
eyes and a fresh pretty face and a small bright blue
hat sitting tightly on her curls, was at the wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Phyllis Vanderfelt,” she explained. “My
father asked me to drive in and fetch you. He has
had to be away to-day and won’t get home much before
dinner time, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned the car and drove westwards under the
railway arch talking rather quickly as people who are
uneasy and dread an awkward silence will do. They
passed through a little town of narrow winding streets
and high walls clustered under a great church with
a leaping spire, like a piece of old France, and swung
out onto a high wide road which dipped and rose, with
the great ridge of the South Downs sweeping from
Chanctonbury Ring to Hampshire on their left, forests
and bush-strewn slopes of emerald and cliffs of chalk
silver-white in the sun, and from end to end of the
high rolling barrier the swift shadows of the clouds
flitting like great birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had ceased to talk now and there was no awkwardness
in the silence. Paul was leaning forward
gazing about him with a queer look of eagerness upon
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To come home to country like this!” he said in a
low voice. “You can’t think what it means after
months of brown earth and hot skies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon their right a low wall bordered the road, and
on the other side of the wall fallow-deer grazed in a
Park. Beyond, a line of tall oaks freshly green was
the home of innumerable rooks who strewed the air
about the topmost branches, wheeling and cawing. The
square tower of a church stood upon a little hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s friendly, isn’t it?” he cried, and a look of commiseration
made the eyes of the girl at his side tender.
Would he think this countryside so friendly when the
evening was over and he had got to his room?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know our Downs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis spoke at random and hastily as he turned
towards her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” he answered. “Could I have forgotten
them if I had once known them? I seem to have been
within a finger’s breadth of recognising something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you have seen my mother we will walk
through the village. We shall have time before dinner,”
said Phyllis, and she turned the car into the
carriage-way of a square old house with big windows
level with the wall, which stood close to the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vanderfelt, a middle-aged woman with shrewd
and kindly eyes received him with a touch of nervousness
in her manner and, as her daughter had done,
talked volubly and a little at random whilst she was
giving him some tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what you would like to do until dinner
time,” she said, and Phyllis said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to show Mr. Ravenel the village.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A glance of comprehension was swiftly exchanged
between the mother and the daughter, but not so
swiftly but that Paul intercepted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can get the key at Rapley’s,” said Mrs. Vanderfelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two young people came to four cross-roads, and
Paul exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up the hill to the right, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They mounted the hill and Paul stopped. He pointed
with his stick towards the signboard of an inn built on
the high bank above the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I know. I lived here once as a child. I always
wondered why the Horse Guards had an inn
here, and what sort of people they were. I used to
imagine that they were half-horse, like the Centaurs,
and I always hoped to see them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis Vanderfelt laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t that like a man? I show you a place as beautiful
as any in England and the only thing which you
have remembered of it from the time when you were
four is the place where you could get a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the Horseguards’ Inn,” repeated Paul cheerfully.
“Let us go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was now Phyllis who stopped with a face
from which the merriment had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” she said indecisively. “It shall be
as you wish. But I wonder. We talked it all over at
home. We couldn’t tell whether it would be helpful
to you, whether you would care to remember everything
to-morrow—whether you already remembered.
My father was quite clear that you should see everything.
But I am not sure—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul felt the clutch of fear catching his breath once
more as he looked into the girl’s compassionate eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am with your father,” he said. “My recollections
are too faint. I can only remember what I see. Let
us go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis Vanderfelt went into one of the cottages and
came out again with a big key in her hand. Beyond
the cottages a thick high hedge led on to an old rose-red
house with an oriel window looking down the
road from beneath a gable and a tiled roof golden
with lichen. Wisteria draped the walls in front with
purple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is empty,” said Phyllis, as she put the key into
the lock and opened the door. The rooms were all
dismantled, the floors uncarpeted. Paul Ravenel shook
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I remember nothing here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis led him through a window into a garden.
A group of beech trees sheltered the house from the
southwest wind and beyond the beech trees from a
raised lawn their eyes swept over meadows and a low
ridge of black firs and once more commanded the
shining Downs. Paul stood for a little while in silence,
whilst Phyllis watched his face. There came upon it
a look of perplexity and doubt. He turned back towards
the house. On its south side, a window had
been thrown out; on its tiled roof a wide band of
white clematis streamed down like a great scarf. On
the wall beside the window a great magnolia climbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a moment,” cried Paul; and as he gazed his
vision cleared. He saw, as the gifted see in a crystal,
a scene small and distant and very bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a table raised up on some sort of stand
upon the gravel paths outside this window. A man
was sitting at the table and a small crowd of people,
laughing and jeering a little—an unkindly crowd—was
gathered about him. And furniture and ornaments
were brought out. He turned to Phyllis.
“There was a sale here, ever so long ago—and I was
present outside the crowd, looking on. I lived here,
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Phyllis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was our furniture which was being sold?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far there was no surprise for Paul Ravenel,
nothing which conflicted with his conception and estimate
of his father. Monsieur Ravenel had sold off
his furniture, just as he had changed his name and
abode. It was part of the process of destroying all
his associations with the country and people of his
birth. Only—his recollections had revealed something
new to him—and disquietingly significant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why were those who came to buy unfriendly and
contemptuous?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure that they were?” Phyllis returned.
But she did not look at Paul’s face and her voice was
a little unsteady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very sure about that,” said Paul. “A woman
was with me, holding my hand. She led me away—yes—I
was frightened by those noisy, jeering people,
and she led me away. It was my nurse, I suppose.
For my mother was dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Phyllis, and then, not knowing how
hard she struck, she added, “Your mother had died a
couple of months before the sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel, during the last days, had been schooling
himself to a reserve of manner, but this statement,
as of a thing well known which he too must be supposed
to know, loosened all his armour. A startled
cry burst from his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” he exclaimed, and with a frightened
glance at his white face Phyllis repeated her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you knew,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul walked a little apart. One of the garden paths
was bordered by some arches of roses. He stood by
them, plucking at one or two of the flowers and seeing
none of them at all. The keystone of the explanation
which he had built in order to account for and
uphold his father was down now and with it the
whole edifice. It had all depended upon the idea of
a passionate, enduring love in his father’s heart for
the wife who had died in giving birth to her son, the
enemy. And in that idea there was no truth at all!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul reflected now in bitterness that there never had
been any reason why he should have held his belief—any
wild outburst from Monsieur Ravenel, any word
of tender remembrance. He had got his illusion—yes,
he reached the truth now in this old garden—from an
instinct to preserve himself from hating that stranger
with whom he lived and on whom he depended for his
food and the necessities of his life. He turned suddenly
back to Phyllis Vanderfelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I don’t understand, Miss Phyllis, is how it is
that remembering so much of other things here, I can
remember nothing of my mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She only came home here to die,” Phyllis replied
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul pressed his hands over his eyes for a moment
or two in a gesture of pain which made the young
girl’s heart ache for him. But he looked at her calmly
afterwards and said: “I am afraid that Colonel Vanderfelt
has very bad news to tell me to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis Vanderfelt laid her hand gently upon his
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will remember that you have made very real
friends here in a very short time, won’t you?” she
pleaded. “My mother and myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet another shock was waiting for him in Colonel
Vanderfelt’s house. For as he entered the drawing
room three-quarters of an hour later, a tall man lifted
himself with an effort from an easy chair and with
the help of a stick limped across the room towards
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my husband,” said Mrs. Vanderfelt, and
before Paul could check his tongue, the cry had sprung
from his lips:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man with the medals!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The older man’s eyes flashed with a sudden anger.
Mrs. Vanderfelt gasped and flushed red. Phyllis took
a step forward. All had a look as if they had suffered
some bitter and intolerable insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul quickly explained. “My father and I crossed
you one night a long time ago when you were coming
from a banquet at the Guildhall. You called to my
father. I was a child, and I always remembered you
as the man with the medals. The phrase jumped out
when I saw you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire died out of Colonel Vanderfelt’s eyes. A
look of pity sheathed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will talk of all these things after dinner,” he
said gently, and his hand clasped the youth’s arm.
“Let us go in now.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<h3>At King’s Corner</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“F</span>erguson</span> wrote to me that you mean to return
to your own race,” said Colonel Vanderfelt,
when the ladies had withdrawn from
the dining room. He was a small, wiry man, dark of
complexion, with a sleek black head of hair in which
there was not one visible thread of grey. His face
too was hardly lined, so that it was not until one looked
at his eyes that one got any impression of age. The
eyes, however, betrayed him. Deeply sunken and with
a queer set appearance, they were the eyes of an old,
old man; and they provoked a guess that they had at
one time gazed so desperately upon horrors that they
could never again quite get free of what they had
seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Paul. “Mr. Ferguson was not very
sympathetic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I think he was wrong,” said Colonel Vanderfelt
heartily. “Philosophers and Labour leaders talk
very placidly about throwing down the walls between
nation and nation, as if it was an easy morning’s work.
But the walls aren’t of our building. They are mother
earth and climate and were there from the beginning
of time. Some people can pass over them, of course—American
women, especially. But very few men aren’t
weaklings, I believe. To the men worth anything,
their soil cries out louder and louder with each year
that passes. A glass of port? Help yourself! A
cigar? No? The cigarettes are in that Battersea box
in front of you. It’s a fiction that tobacco spoils the
flavour of port. Claret, yes! Port, not a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt took a cigar from a box upon
a side table, lit it and resumed his seat. Paul brought
him back to the subject of their talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad to hear you agree with me, Colonel
Vanderfelt. I have been more and more convinced
since I have sat in this room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel looked about the dining room with
its fastidious and sober elegance. Cream walls, upon
which a few good prints were hung; a bright red
screen drawn in front of the door; shapely old furniture
with red upholstery, and heavy curtains of red
brocaded silk at the one big bow window; a long,
slender Sheraton sideboard against the wall; a fine
Chippendale cabinet in a recess; and this round gleaming
table of mahogany, with its candlesticks and salt-cellars
of Battersea enamel, its silver equipment and
its short tubby decanters with the blue tinge of old
Waterford in the glass; in every aspect of the room
grace was so wedded to homeliness, comfort to distinction
that Paul could not but envy its possessors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I resume my race and with it of course my name,”
he said, keenly watching Colonel Vanderfelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Colonel Vanderfelt took his cigar from his lips
only to ask a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?” he enquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I propose to try for a commission in the
army,” Paul replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Colonel Vanderfelt, “but the Bar
offers more opportunities to a young fellow nowadays,
doesn’t it? Why the Army? There are other
professions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for me, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt shrugged his shoulders and
stared at the shining table in front of him. It was a
devil of a world—everything cross-wise and upside
down and unaccommodating. Why must this youth
with money and the world to choose from, choose just
the one bunch of grapes quite out of his reach? And
set his very heart on it too. There had been a ring
in that “Not for me, sir!” which could not be stilled
by argument. It was youth’s challenge to the elders,
its “I know better” which there was no use in debating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hear,” said Colonel Vanderfelt; and the
lad’s ambitions were shyly revealed to him. Histories
of campaigns, the lives of great soldiers, books of
strategy too technical for him to follow—these had
been his favourite reading. It was the actual work of
the soldier which had fascinated Paul, not the glitter
of the great days of parades and manœuvres, but his
daily responsibilities and the command of men and the
glory of service. Colonel Vanderfelt listened and
nodded and remembered a phrase in Mr. Ferguson’s
letter: “The boy’s of the right temper.” Surely he
was, and the whole business was perverse and pitiful!
He heard Paul closing his little apologia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see, sir, from the time when I began to
think at all of what I should do in the world, this has
always been my wish.” The lad was seeking to challenge
and defy, but the anxiety which had tortured him
during the last four days turned the challenge into a
prayer. He searched Colonel Vanderfelt’s face for a
sign of agreement. “I know of nothing,” he asserted,
“of nothing at all which should hinder me from trying
to fulfil my wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I do,” replied the other. “I think, Paul, that
it would be very difficult for you to take your father’s
name and seek a commission in the Army here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul’s cigarette had gone out whilst he was speaking.
He lit it now at one of the candles with trembling
fingers. The gentleness of Colonel Vanderfelt’s voice
made him think of some compassionate judge passing
sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will, I trust, make that clear to me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” returned the Colonel. “I admit to you
that up to the last few minutes I had hoped to escape,
and leave most of the story untold. And had you
chosen another profession, why, very likely I should
have spared you and myself, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he had promised to be frank, he was
reluctant to begin and he had ended on so evident a
note of discomfort and pain that Paul Ravenel dared
not interpose a word. The windows stood open upon
the garden and let into the room the perfume of flowers
and the freshness of the dew. Outside was the
glamorous twilight of a summer night. It was very
still. Occasionally a bird rustled the leaves of a
branch; and across a field a cuckoo whose voice was
breaking called incessantly. Paul was never to forget
that background to these moments of suspense. All
the bitterness was not with him on this night. Colonel
Vanderfelt was back in the dark places of his life
amongst old shames and miseries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father’s name was John Edward Revel,”
he began, and the boy drew a long breath. “Yes, the
infantry manual was his, some relic of the old days
that he must keep, I suppose—some one small valueless
thing—yes, I think that’s natural. He and I were
friends. We passed out of Sandhurst together and
met again in India. Years afterwards—Service
brought us together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He named an outlying post in the hills to the northwest
of Quetta where John Edward Revel and he lay
beleaguered during one of the frontier wars. They
were ordered to hold on to their position at all costs
and help would come to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were neither of us youngsters, you must understand,
pitchforked into commands we weren’t fit
for. We had seen a lot of service and done well—both
of us. That makes the matter worse perhaps.
All the less excuse! That’s what they did say! We
were losing men all the time, and we hadn’t many to
begin with. Ammunition was running low, water still
lower, we were attacked day and night, we two had
no sleep, and the promised relief didn’t come. The
Baluchis got into our outer court one evening and we
had the greatest trouble to get them out. The same
night one of our spies came in with the news that a
fresh big force was hurrying to reinforce the Baluchis.
We were pretty well at the end of our tether—Ravel
and I—. Something snapped in both of us .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we
slipped out under cover of darkness, the whole force,
and fell back in spite of our instructions, leaving this
key-post unguarded. And the new enemy we fell back
from was our own relief expedition which had marched
night and day and turned the Baluchis’ flank. They
found the fort empty, which we had been ordered at
all costs to hold. You can guess what happened. We
were arrested, court-martialled—cashiered! So you
can understand perhaps now our queer reception of
you in the drawing room this evening. When you
startled us by calling me, ‘The man with the medals,’
it sounded like some bitter jibe from those bad days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t understand,” Paul Ravenel stammered.
“You were cashiered both of you, you and my father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I saw you coming from a dinner at the Guildhall,
with your medals upon your breast. You are here
in your own home, wearing your rank! How can that
be, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt replied with a curious accent of
apology to his young guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was lucky. I had served in India longer than
your father. I had been more interested; and dialects
came to me easily. More than once I had spent my
leave living in the Bazaars, and as far north as Leh.
Therefore it wasn’t so difficult for me. I disappeared.
I’m a dark man naturally. I grew a beard. I joined
a battalion of irregular levies. I served for three years
in it on the frontier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did no one guess who you were?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think one or two suspected and—winked. They
were busy years you see. A good deal was going on
all this time and men who knew anything about soldiering
were valuable. Of course they were pretty
rough, hard years for any one with delicate tastes, but
there was so much to be perhaps regained,” and Colonel
Vanderfelt pulled himself up quickly. “Well, after
three years I was wounded rather badly. As you see
I limp to this day. It looked then as if the game was
up altogether and I was going out. So I sent a message
in my own name to an officer on the border whom
I had known. The Governor of Quetta came up himself
to see me in hospital and the end of it was that
my sentence was annulled. There, my boy, that’s the
whole story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt rose from his chair and limping
over to the window looked out upon that quiet garden,
which he had lost, and after such unlovely years won
back again. They were years of which he could never
think even now without a shiver of disgust and a cold
fear lest by some impossibility they should come again.
None indeed had ever known the full measure of their
abasement and squalor and degradation. Even with
the great prize continually held in view, they had been
hardly endurable. The chance of winning it had been
the chance of a raft to a man drowning in the Pacific.
The voice of Paul Ravenel who was still seated at the
table broke in upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s the whole story, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The whole story, sir, except that what you did—my
father didn’t. Therefore he lived and died an outcast,”
and the young man’s voice died away in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt turned back to him and laid his
hand upon Paul’s shoulder and shook it in a gentle
sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s another question I would like to have answered,”
said Paul. He was very pale, but his voice
was firm again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The disgrace, I suppose, killed my mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no right to say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The truth, sir, please!” and the appeal came so
clearly from a man in the extremity of torture, that
Colonel Vanderfelt could not but answer it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It did. She was in India when this shameful business
happened. She came home and died.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments Paul began to laugh. The laughter
was pitched in a low key and horrible to hear; and
there was such a flame of agony burning in the boy’s
eyes and so dreadful a grin upon his white face that
Colonel Vanderfelt feared for his reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steady, Paul, steady!” he said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of the fine myth by which I explained
everything to the honour of the family,” Paul
cried in a bitter voice. “Our seclusion, the antagonism
between my father and me, the change of name—it
was all due to a morbid grief at the loss of a wife too
deeply loved. That’s what I believed, sir,” he said
wildly, but Colonel Vanderfelt had already learned
of these delusions from Mr. Ferguson. “And shame’s
the explanation. Disgrace is the explanation. He
killed my mother with it and now the son too must
hide!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Colonel Vanderfelt with decision.
“There’s a good way out of this tangle for you, a way
by which you may still reach all you have set your
heart on—your career, your name and an honoured
place amongst your own people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul lifted incredulous eyes to the other man’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” insisted the older man. “You don’t believe
me. You young fellows see only the worst and the
best, and if the best doesn’t tumble into your hands,
you are sure at once that there’s nothing for you but
the worst. Just listen to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took hold upon himself. He was ashamed already
of his outburst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very kind, sir,” he said, and some appreciation
of the goodwill which the older man had
shown to him, in baring his own wounds, and drawing
out into the light again old humiliations and guilt
long since atoned, pierced even through the youth’s
sharp consciousness of his own miseries. He rose up
from his chair. He was in command of his emotions
now, his voice was steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been thinking too much of myself and the
distress into which this revelation has plunged me,”
he said, “and too little of your great consideration
and kindness. What you have told me, you cannot
have said without pain and a good deal of reluctance.
I am very grateful. Indeed I wonder why you ever
received me here at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would have found out the truth without my
help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I mean,” said Paul. “I should have
found it out through an enquiry agent, and the news
would have been ten times more hideous coming in
that way rather than broken gently here. Whilst on
the other hand you would have spared yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” Colonel Vanderfelt answered
uncomfortably, and to himself he added: “Yes, old
Ferguson wrote the truth. That boy’s clean and a
gentleman.” He pressed Paul down into his chair
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come! Take a glass of this old brandy first—it’s
not so bad—and then we’ll talk your prospects over
like the men of the world we both are—eh? Neither
making light of serious things nor exaggerating them
until we make endeavour useless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He fetched to the table a couple of big goblets
mounted on thin stems within which delicate spirals
had been blown, and poured a liqueur of his best
brandy into each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an idea, Paul. It has been growing all the
time we have been talking together. Let’s see if it
means anything to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held his goblet to his nose and smelt the brandy.
“Pretty good, this! Try it, Paul. There’s not a
cough nor a splutter in it. Well, now,” he went on
when Paul had taken his advice, “in the first place, you
are eighteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a man of means?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have property in Casablanca, in Morocco?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir,” said Paul, wondering whither all these
questions were to lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you lived there for some years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Before I went to school in France and my
father built his house in Aguilas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know Arabic, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Moorish dialect, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And by nationality you are French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Paul reluctantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good,” said the Colonel, warming to his theme.
“Now listen to me. The French must move in Morocco,
as we moved in India, as we moved in Egypt.
It isn’t a question of policies or persons. It’s the
question of the destiny of a great nation. The instinct
of life and self-preservation in a great nation
which sooner or later breaks all policies and persons
that stand in the way. There’ll be the timid ones
who’ll say no! And there’ll be the intriguers who’ll
treat the question as a pawn to be moved in their own
interest. But in the end they won’t matter.” Colonel
Vanderfelt had a complete and not very knowledgeable
contempt for politics and politicians like most of his
calling until they have joined the ranks of the politicians
themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morocco can’t remain as it is—a vast country with
a miserable population, misgoverned if governed at all,
with a virgin soil the richest in the world, and within
a few miles of Europe. Somebody’s got to go in and
sort it up. And that some one’s got to be France,
for she can’t afford a possible enemy on her Algerian
frontier. Yes, but there’ll be trouble before she succeeds
in her destiny, trouble and—opportunity.” The
Colonel paused to let that word sink into Paul’s mind.
“Why not be one of those who’ll seize it? They are
great soldiers, the French. Join them, since that’s
your way of life. Go through the schools, get your
commission in France and then strive heart and soul
to get service in the country whose language you know,
the country of opportunity. Then, in God’s good
time, if you still so wish it, come back here, resume
your own name, rejoin your own race!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel, from his solitary dreaming life and
his age, was inclined to be impressed by thoughts of
sacrifice and expiation and atonement. He was therefore
already half persuaded by Colonel Vanderfelt’s advice.
It would be exile, as he had come to think, but it
would also be a cleansing of his name, an expiation of
his father’s crime. And after all, when he looked at
the man who gave him this advice, and remembered
what he had endured with a hope so much more infinitesimal,
the course proposed to him seemed fortunate
and light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said. “I should like to think over
your idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt was pleased that there had been
no flighty hysterical acceptance, no assumption that
the goal was as good as reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, take your time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt rose and, removing the shades,
blew out the candles upon the dining-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what you would like to do?” he said,
turning to the lad. “You will follow your own wish,
of course. And if you would rather go straight now
to your room, why, we shall all understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, but I should prefer to join the ladies
with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt smiled very pleasantly. The
anticipation of Paul’s visit had caused him a sleepless
night or two and not a little pain. How much should
he tell? The question had been troubling him, so that
he had more than once sat down to write to Mr.
Ferguson that he would not receive the boy at all.
He was very glad now that he had, and that he had
kept nothing back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, then,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the drawing room Phyllis Vanderfelt sang to that
little company some songs of old Herrick in a small,
very sweet, clear voice. Paul sat near the long, open
window. The music, the homely friendliness within
the room, and the quiet garden over which slept so
restful a peace were all new to him and wrought upon
him till he felt the tears rising to his eyes. Phyllis’
hands were taken from the keys and lay idle in her
lap. In the high trees of the Park upon the far side
of the road the owls were calling and the cuckoo still
repeated his two notes from the tree beyond the field.
Paul rose suddenly to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That throaty old cuckoo means to make a night of
it,” he said with a laugh which was meant to hide the
break in his voice and did not succeed. He stepped
over the threshold and was out of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him be!” said Colonel Vanderfelt. And a
little later, when Phyllis had taken herself off to bed:
“I liked him very much. The right temper—that’s
the phrase old Ferguson used. He’ll do well, Milly—you’ll
see. We shall see him home here one day carrying
his sheaves,” and as his wife remained silent he
looked at her anxiously. “Don’t you agree with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” Mrs. Vanderfelt answered slowly.
“I hope so with all my heart. But—didn’t you notice
his looks and a sort of grace he has?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” asked the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we have left out one consideration altogether.
What part are women going to play in his life? A
large one. Tom, I have been watching Phyllis to-night.
A day or so more, and we should have an
aching heart in this house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I see,” returned Colonel Vanderfelt. “Women
do upset things, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or get upset,” said Mrs. Vanderfelt. “And sometimes
both.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<h3>Betwixt and Between</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>aul Ravenel</span> left Colonel Vanderfelt’s
house of King’s Corner on the next morning in
time to catch an early train to London. His
friends gathered in the drive to wave him a good-bye
as he drove away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll write to us, won’t you?” said Mrs. Vanderfelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s a room here whenever you have an
evening to spare,” added the Colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul had quite captured the hearts of the small
household and they were hardly less concerned for his
future and his success than they would have been had
he been their own son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul had given no hint at the breakfast table of his
plans, if indeed he had yet formed any, nor did his
friends press him with any question. But they waited
anxiously for letters and in time one came with the
postmark of St. Germain. Paul had passed into St.
Cyr. Others followed with lively enough accounts of
his surroundings and companions. Here and there
the name of a friend was mentioned, Gerard de
Montignac, Paul’s senior by a year, for instance, who
cropped up more often than any one else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They heard later that he had passed out with honours
and was now a sub-lieutenant in the 174th Regiment,
stationed at Marseilles; then a couple of years
later, just at the time when Phyllis was married, that
he had been seconded to the 2nd Tirailleurs and was
on active service amongst the Beni-Snassen in Algeria.
He escaped from that campaign without any
hurt and wrote a little account of it to his friends at
King’s Corner, with some shrewd pictures of his commanders
and brother officers. But the same reticence
overspread the pages. Mrs. Vanderfelt was at a loss to
recapture out of them a picture of the lad who had
stayed one night with them and borne so gallantly the
destruction of his boyish illusions. The letters, to her
thinking, might have been written by an automaton
with a brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few months afterwards Colonel Vanderfelt
slammed down his newspaper on the breakfast table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where Paul ought to be. I told him! You
can’t blame me! I told him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long-expected trouble in Morocco was coming
to a head. The extravagance and incapacity of the
Sultan Abd-el-Aziz; the concession of the Customs to
the French; the jealousies of powerful kaids; and the
queer admixture of contempt and fear with which the
tribes watched the encroachments of Europeans; all
these elements were setting the country on fire. Already
there were rumours of disorder in the wealthy
coast town of Casablanca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where Paul ought to be,” cried Colonel
Vanderfelt angrily. But his anger was appeased in a
couple of days. For he received a letter from Paul
with the postmark of Oran, written on shipboard. He
and his battalion were on their way to Casablanca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They arrived after the bombardment and massacres,
and served under General D’Amade throughout the
campaigns of the Chaiouïa. Paul was wounded in the
thigh during the attack upon Settat but was able to
rejoin his battalion in a month. He was now a senior
Lieutenant and his captain being killed in the fight at
McKoun, he commanded his company until the district
was finally pacified by the victory over the great kaid
and Marabout, Bou Nuallah. Paul had done well; he
was given the medaille and at the age of twenty-six
was sure that his temporary rank would be confirmed.
He wrote warmly of those days to his friends. There
was a note of confidence and elation which Mrs. Vanderfelt
had not remarked before, and the letter ended
with a short but earnest expression of gratitude to his
friends for the help they had given him eight years
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the next two years, then, the household at
King’s Corner read only of the routine of a great camp,
described with a lively spirit and an interest in the
little trifles of his profession, which was a clear proof
to them all that Paul had seen straight and clearly
when he had declared: “There’s no other profession
for me.” Thereafter came news which thrilled his
audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am transferred to the General Staff,” Paul wrote,
“and am leaving here on special service. You must
not expect to hear from me for a long while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither Colonel Vanderfelt nor his wife had quite
realised how they had counted on Paul’s letters, or
what a fresh, lively interest they brought into their
quiet lives, until this warning reached them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we can’t expect to hear,” said Colonel
Vanderfelt irritably, “Paul’s probably on very important
service. Very often a postmark’s enough to give
a clue. But you women don’t understand these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phyllis, the married daughter, and Mrs. Vanderfelt
were the women to whom this rebuke was addressed,
and neither of them had said a word to provoke it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt, dear,” Mrs. Vanderfelt replied meekly,
with a private smile for the daughter. “We shall hear
in due time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the weeks ran into months, the months into a
year, and still no letter came. At one moment they
wondered whether new associations had not obliterated
from Paul’s mind his former aspirations: at another,
whether he still lived. Colonel Vanderfelt ran across
Mr. Ferguson towards the end of the year outside his
club in Piccadilly and made enquiries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever hear of that boy, Paul Ravenel,
again?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, he’s a rich man now and I have acted for
him,” returned Mr. Ferguson. “Since the French occupation,
land in and around Casablanca has gone up
to fifty times its former value. Ravenel has realised
some of it. I have bought the freehold of his father’s
house close to you and let it for seven years and invested
a comfortable sum for him in British securities.
So I gather that he means to come back in a little
while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt was relieved upon one score, but
it was only to have his anxiety increased upon the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When did you hear from Paul last?” he asked,
and Mr. Ferguson answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some while ago. Let me think. Yes, it must be
a year at the least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt repeated the conversation to his
wife on his return to King’s Corner, and both of them
shirked the question which was heavy at their hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be pleasant to have him as a neighbour,”
said Mrs. Vanderfelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied the Colonel. “And it might be quite
soon! Seven years he has let the house for. And we
are getting no younger, are we! The sooner the better,
I say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some look upon his wife’s face, a droop of her
shoulders, made him stop; and it was in a quiet and
strangely altered voice that he began again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are both pretending, Milly, and that’s the truth.
We are afraid. It would be hard lines if he died
before he did what he aimed to do. Yet we have got
to face that possibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Vanderfelt was turning over a plan in her
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that it’s time we had news of him,” she
said. “There’s a friend he has mentioned several
times in his letters. He was with him at St. Cyr and
met him again at Casablanca—Gerard de Montignac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt went in search of Paul Ravenel’s
letters. They were kept in a drawer of the writing-table
in his bedroom and made a big bundle by now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“De Montignac. That was the fellow’s name. Let’s
look at the last ones for his rank. He’s a captain of
the Chasseurs d’Afrique. I’ll write to Casablanca to-night,
my dear, on the chance of his still being there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Vanderfelt was easier in his mind after he
had posted the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a good idea of mine, Millie,” he said to
his wife. “We shall get some news now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was still in Casablanca, but
at the time when Colonel Vanderfelt was writing to
him, he was himself just as anxious as the Colonel
about the safety of Paul Ravenel.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<h3>The Villa Iris</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“T</span>here’s</span> not the slightest reason for alarm,”
Gerard de Montignac declared testily in
much the same tone which Colonel Vanderfelt
was using to his wife nearly two thousand miles
away. De Montignac was dining at the “popote” of
his battalion in the permanent camp of Ain-Bourdja
outside the walls of Casablanca, and more than once
of late Ravenel’s long absence had cropped up in the
conversation with a good deal of shaking of heads.
“Paul is a serious one,” continued Gerard. “Too serious.
That is his fault. He will not pack up and
return until the last possible observation is taken, the
last notes of value written down in his little book.
But then he will. I am not afraid for him, no, not
the least bit in the world. And who should be, I ask
you, if I am not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced round the mess but not one of his companions
accepted his challenge. It was not, however,
because they shared his confidence. Indeed every one
was well aware that more than half of it was assumed.
They respected a great friendship sealed nearly three
years before on the bloody slopes of R’Fakha. De
Montignac, with his squadron of Chasseurs, had ridden
in that desperate charge by means of which alone
the crest of the plateau had been held until the infantry
arrived. The charge had been made down a
hillside seamed with tiny gullies invisible until they
gaped beneath the horses’ feet; and the difficulties of
the ground had so split the small force of cavalry that
the attack became a series of scattered tourneys in
which each overmatched trooper drove at a group of
Moors armed with rifles and many of them mounted.
There had been but ten minutes of the unequal fight,
but those minutes were long enough for each man who
fell wounded to pray with all his soul that the wound
might be swift and mortal and do its work before the
mutilating knife flashed across his face. Gerard de
Montignac lay half way down the slope with a bullet
in his shoulder and his thigh pinned to the ground
beneath the weight of his grey charger. The Moors
were already approaching him when Paul’s company
of Tirailleurs doubled up to the crest and Paul recognised
the horse. His rescue of his friend was one of
twenty such acts done upon that day, but the memory
of them all lived and stopped many an argument as it
did to-night. If Gerard de Montignac chose to cry
obstinately: “Some day Paul Ravenel will walk in
upon us. He is my friend. I know,” it was the part of
friendliness to acquiesce. There were other topics for
dispute, enough in all conscience; such as the new
dancing girl who had come that week to Madame Delagrange’s
Bar, the Villa Iris, and about whom young
Ollivier Praslin was raving at the other end of the
table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel had slipped quietly away now more
than a year ago in the black gabardine and skull cap
of a Jew pedlar with a few surveying instruments
packed in cheap, dirty boxes of white wood hidden
amongst his wares on the back of a mule, and a few
penny account books in which to jot his notes. He
set out to explore the countries of the Beni-M’Tir and
the Gerouan tribes, to blacken the white spaces of the
map by means of long and perilous journeys. There
were no tribes more implacable and fanatical than
these; none whose territories at that time were so little
known; and since they held the mountain passes and
the great forests which border the trade routes from
the south and the west to Fez, none whose strongholds
and numbers and resources it was more important
that the Administration should know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Jew travelling alone, carrying on a mule such
valuable things as needles and reels of thread, matches
and safety pins, and some bales of cloth will be able
to go where even a Moor of another tribe would lose
his life,” he had declared, and for a long time in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about your notes? How will you make
them?” asked the officer of the Affaires Indigènes, to
whom after much persistence he was referred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a shorthand. They will take little space.
I have a small tent, too. I shall make them at night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if you are caught making them at night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be making up my accounts—that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Native Department, however, still shook its
head. “A Jew will be robbed, no doubt, and probably
kicked and cuffed from tent village to tent village,”
pleaded Ravenel. “But he will not be killed. He carries
useful things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the end his persistence had won the day. He had
been given a list of a few sure friends, a kaid here and
there, on whose good will he could rely; and once or
twice some news of him from one or other of these
friends had come in a roundabout fashion to the headquarters
of the Administration at Rabat. But the last
of these messages were more than six months old, and
Paul Ravenel himself was two months’ overdue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was gloomily weighing up his
friend’s chances when a louder burst of laughter came
from young Lieutenant Praslin’s corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you she is young and she is pretty, and she
can dance,” Praslin was protesting, quite red in the face
with the fervour of his defence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she is at old Delagrange’s Bar in Casablanca!”
cried an officer, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here at all events was a statement which could be
received with incredulity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am not the only one to say so,” exclaimed
Praslin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we must admit that the case is serious,” said
Commandant Marnier very gravely. “Come, let us
consider the case of the young lady. Who is this
other who agrees with you, my friend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Praslin began to stammer. Commandant Marnier
of the Zouaves was the heavy gun of the mess, a disillusioned
man of forty-five with a satirical and at
times a bitter tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is this other?” he asked, leaning forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little Boutreau of the Legion,” Praslin answered
miserably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Name of a name, here is an authority!” cried the
Commandant. “And how old is the little Boutreau?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-four.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes? And where has the little Boutreau been stationed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Praslin’s voice got smaller and smaller as he
replied: “For the last two years on an advanced post
upon the Algerian frontier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where no doubt he has had full opportunity to
compute the beauty of women,” said the Commandant
sagely. “I think we can now construct a picture of
this houri. She will be fifty if she is a day. In the
colour and texture of her skin she will be very like
a fig. Not all the kohl in the East will lend a sparkle
to her eyes, nor all the red salve freshness to her faded
lips. She will wear a red dress with a swaying whale-boned
skirt glittering with spangles and she will tell
you that she dined at the Ritz in Paris a fortnight
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The description was not inept, but his voice changed
now into a snarl. Commandant Marnier had the ill
humour of men who sit all their lives in the company
of their juniors and see themselves overpassed by each
in turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ladies of the Villa Iris! Have we not all
sought our good fortune at their hands? The poor
pilgrims! Here they have reached the last stage but
one in their doleful Pilgrimage. Paris, Madrid, Barcelona,
Oran, Tangiers, Casablanca and then up on the
supply wagons to the advanced Posts of the Legion
from which there is no return! Francine, Florette,
Hortense—oh, the pretty names! Yes, that’s about
all they have left when they reach this fine metropolis
of Casablanca—their pretty names!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose with a contemptuous movement from his
chair, and Gerard de Montignac asked carelessly, with
a mind far away from the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is the name of this girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite Lambert, an American,” replied Praslin,
and close by Gerard, a young lieutenant of spahis
who had disembarked that morning from Oran raised
himself half out of his chair and sank back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know her, too?” Gerard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied the lieutenant. “Yet I have danced
with her”; and he sat wondering not so much that
Marguerite Lambert had come to Casablanca as that
he should not have guessed after that short stay of
hers at Oran that it was to Casablanca she must and
would come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac moved round the table to
Henri Ratenay, an officer of his own regiment who had
made the campaign of Chaiouïa with him and
Ravenel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go to the Villa Iris?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ratenay laughed and lifted his cap down from a
peg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! Has Praslin fired you? Let us go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But outside the long wooden building with its
verandah of boards, Gerard de Montignac stopped.
Marguerite Lambert roused no curiosity in him at this
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man from the Native Department called Baumann
came from Rabat to-day to see the General. I
hear that he has some news of Paul. He returns to
Rabat to-morrow, but I was told that I might find him
to-night at the Villa Iris. Let us go, then! For
though I laugh, I am very anxious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was an officer of a type not
rare in the French Army. An aristocrat to his finger
tips, a youth with one foot in the drawing rooms of
the Faubourg and the other in the cafés of Montmartre,
and contemptuous of politics, he had turned
his back on Paris like so many of his kind and sought
a career in the colonial army of France. He kept up
a plentiful correspondence with the beautiful ladies of
his acquaintance, which did him no good with his
masters at the War Office. For the ladies would quote
his letters at their dinner parties. “What do you
think? I had a letter from Gerard to-day. He says
that such a mistake was made, etc., etc.” But he was
not a gossip. He was a student, a soldier with a note
book and more than one little brochure giving a limpid
account of a campaign, bore witness to his ambition
and his zeal. He was twenty-nine at this date, a year
and a half older than Paul; gay and unexacting in his
pleasures. “One soon gets used to the second best,”
was a phrase of his, capable of much endurance and
under a gay demeanour rather hard; a good comrade
but a stern enemy; with no liking for games and not
a sportsman at all in the English sense, but a brilliant
horseman, a skilled fencer and hard, throughout his
long lean body, as flesh can be. Women had not
touched him deeply but he loved to be spoken of
amongst them; he was flattered that one woman should
envy another because that other received letters from
him; if he had a passion at all it was for this country
in which he served and to which he gave gladly his
years of youth and his years of manhood. It was a
new thing to him, half problem, half toy, at once a
new rib to the frame of France and a jewel to be
worthily set. On the one hand a country which wide
motor roads and schools of intensive farming and the
conversion of migratory tribes into permanent householders
would develop, on the other a place of beautiful
shrines and exquisite archways and grim old
kasbahs with crenelated walls which must be preserved
against the encroaching waves of commerce. In appearance
he was thin and long and without pretension
to good looks. His hair was receding a little from his
forehead; and his nose was sharp and gave to his face
the suggestion of a sabre; and he was as careful of his
hands and his finger nails as if he were still living
amongst the Duchesses. Moreover, he had a great
love of Paul Ravenel, and as he looked about him on
that hot night of early April, his anxiety increased.
For the town was thronged with new troops, new companies
of sappers, new artillery men. The information
from the interior of the country was alarming. The
fires of hatred were blazing up against Mulai Hafid,
the new Sultan, as they had three years before against
Abd-el-Aziz. And for the same reason. He had sold
himself and his country to the Christians. Throughout
the town there was excitement and unrest. A
movement must be made forward and this time to Fez.
Rumour had it that the Sultan was actually beleaguered
there. And somewhere out in the wild, fierce country
Paul Ravenel was wandering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us hurry!” said Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Villa Iris stood in one of the meanest of the
alleys to the left of the great landward gate—a dingy,
long, green house with all its windows on the street
carefully shuttered and something sinister in its aspect,
as though it was the house of dark stories. When
De Montignac and Ratenay stopped in front of it not
a light was showing, but from somewhere far within
there came the tinkle of a piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montignac pushed open the door and took a step
down into a long, dark passage. They advanced for
a few feet and then the door at the other end was
thrown open, letting in a glare of lights and a great
noise. Some one with the light behind him came towards
them. Beyond that he was an officer in uniform
they knew nothing of him until they heard his
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have come to see for yourself, eh?” he
cried gaily. “But you will do more than see to-night.
Such a crowd in there!” and Praslin went past them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the world was he talking about?” asked
Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite Lambert, I suppose,” replied Ratenay
with a laugh. Gerard, for his part, had forgotten all
about her. Nor did she dwell at all in his thoughts
now. He went vaguely forward and found himself
in a grotesque imitation of a Moorish room, cheap
tiles of the bathroom kind, pillars carved and painted
to mimic the delicate handicraft of Moorish workmen,
a blaze of light from unshaded globes, and a long,
glittering bar behind which Madame Delagrange presided,
a red-faced woman cast in so opulent a mould
that he who looked at her perspired almost as freely as
she did herself. The bar stood against a wall opposite
to the door, and between there were rows of little three-legged
iron tables, at which Levantines, clerks, shopkeepers
of every nationality and a few French officers
were seated. In front of the tables a few couples
gyrated in a melancholy fashion to a fox-trot thumped
out upon an old and tortured piano by a complacent
Greek. If there could be anything worse on this hot
night than the glare of light and tawdry decorations,
it was the heart-rending racket of the piano. But
dancers, decorations, piano and glare were all lost upon
Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the side of the Bar, wide double doors stood open
upon a platform roofed over with a vine; and in that
doorway stood the officer of the Native Department,
of which he was in search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baumann!” he cried, and crossed the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann, a middle-aged, stockish Alsatian, long
since settled in Algeria, to whom this Bar seemed the
very epitome of devil-may-care luxury and pleasure,
surveyed the Captain of Chasseurs with deference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is gay here,” he said with a smile. “Life, my
Captain, the life of Paris and the Boulevards. You
want to speak to me? Yes? We shall be quieter here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned back with almost a sigh of regret to the
boarded verandah under the vines. To Gerard the
verandah was a relief. Here at all events it was cool
and dark, and the piano did not thump upon the brain
with so exasperating a poignancy. There was a table
empty at the end where a couple of steps led down
into a dark garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us sit here!” said Gerard, and when the three
were seated and the drinks ordered from a person of
indefinable nationality dressed up as a Turk, he leaned
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have news of Paul Ravenel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“News? I couldn’t say as much as that,” replied
Baumann. “I was at Meknes when the thing occurred,
before Meknes had declared for its new patent Pretender.
It’s five months ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann checked his speech and looked over
Gerard’s shoulder intently into the dark garden.
Gerard was sitting by the edge of the verandah, with
his face turned eagerly towards Baumann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” Gerard asked impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, I think. Nothing really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But nevertheless Baumann appeared a little uneasy
and his eyes still held their gaze in the same direction.
Ratenay turned. At the first he could see nothing to
account for the alertness which had come so swiftly
into Baumann’s face. Then he made out a black
figure sitting or crouching upon the low edge of the
verandah some way behind Gerard de Montignac, just
in the edge of the lights, and more in shadow than in
light. Gerard had not moved by so much as the
twitch of a limb. He rapped, however, now upon the
iron table with his knuckles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Baumann!” he said sharply. “You were at
Meknes five months ago. Well!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had finished my business,” Baumann replied hurriedly,
but speaking in a lower voice than he had used
before. “I was on my way back to Rabat by the plain
of the Sebou. You know how the track runs from
Meknes, due north over rolling country, then along
the flank of the Zarhoun mountain to a pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half way to the pass stand the Roman ruins of
Volubilis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they lie off the track to the right and close
under the mountain, and worse than that, close under
the sacred City of Mulai Idris, which is forbidden
ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Ratenay and Gerard de Montignac knew well
enough the evil reputation of that inviolate city where
the Founder of the Moorish Empire had his tomb.
A hive of bandits and fanatics who lived upon the
fame of the tomb, and when the offerings were insufficient
made good the balance by murder and highway
robbery. No European could pass within the walls
of that town, and even to approach them was venturesome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I turned off with my small escort,” continued Baumann,
“to visit those ruins, but even before we reached
them we heard a clamour from the walls of the City,
far away as it was. And the leader of the escort was
very anxious that I should not delay amongst those tall,
broken pillars and huge, fallen blocks of stone. So
I hurried over my visit, but even then, half way between
us and the track a line of men armed and some
of them mounted sprang up from the bushes of
asphodel and barred our return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall have to unlock and scour that City one
of these months,” said Gerard de Montignac, little
thinking that it was he upon whom, in after years, the
duty would fall, or what strange and tragic revelations
would be made to him upon that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When they saw that we were soldiers they let us
pass with a few curses, that is, all of them except one,
a young fellow in a ragged djellaba, armed with a great
pole. ‘What are you doing in our country, you dog
of a Christian?’ he screamed at me in a fury, and he
twirled his staff suddenly about his head. He was so
near to me that he could have broken my back with it
before I could have raised a hand to defend myself.
I had just time to understand my danger and then he
grounded his staff and laughed at me. His friends
grinned, too. I expect that I did look rather a fool.
I was thoroughly frightened, I can tell you. The
whole thing had happened so suddenly. I almost felt
my spine snapping,” and Baumann wiped his face with
his handkerchief at the recollection of that great staff
whirling in the air and him helpless upon his horse
with his holsters strapped. “So that until we had
passed them and were back upon the track again, I
didn’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Understand what?” asked Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Understand who had played this joke upon me,”
returned Baumann. “It was Captain Ravenel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure?” he cried. “He was there in Mulai
Idris, one of them!” and Baumann suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush! Don’t turn round. There’s a man behind
you. He has been creeping along the edge of the
verandah. This town is full of spies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard did not turn, but Ratenay, from where he sat,
could see. The black figure crouching well away behind
them on the edge of the raised floor had slipped
quietly towards them, whilst Baumann had been telling
his story. He was now close behind Gerard, squatting
low upon the plank, with his feet in the garden,
a ragged and dusty Jew with a mass of greasy ringlets
struggling from beneath his skull cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac turned swiftly round upon
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want here?” he cried angrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A whiskey and soda!” replied Paul Ravenel. For
that once insular drink had become lately known with
favour to the officers of France.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch6'>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<h3>The Order</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>aul Ravenel</span> reported to the General and
then betook himself to the house by the sea-wall
in which he had spent so much of his boyhood.
He had a month’s furlough and an account of his
wanderings to write. At the end of a week he had
got the stain from his skin and the dye out of his hair,
but he had not got far with his report, not liking the
look of the words as he wrote them down, and composing
the page again to find it no better done than it
had been before. He was sitting despondently at his
writing-table at ten o’clock on one of these evenings,
his hair all rumpled and a chaos of notes spread about
him, when Gerard de Montignac burst into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, I am worn to a shadow with sheer idleness,”
he cried. “Always something is going to happen, never
anything does happen; except ships and ships and
ships and batteries landing and soldiers marching to
God knows where. I can bear no more of it. We
will break out to-night, Paul. We will drink Casablanca
in one draught. We will do something wild
and utterly original.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul looked up and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is rather difficult. To begin with, we might
go to the Villa Iris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That <span class='it'>bouge</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we might dance with Marguerite Lambert, the
American?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who the devil is Marguerite Lambert?” he
asked. Could any good thing come out of the Villa
Iris?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is high time you knew her,” said Gerard de
Montignac decidedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is she like?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t seen her, either. But the little Praslin
says she’s a dream, and the little Boutreau, the little
Boutreau of the Legion cannot sleep at night for
thinking of her. It is high time, Paul, that we both
made her acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daren’t risk catching the little Boutreau’s malady
until I have finished this report.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. But I want to go back to my battalion
and command my company. Some day we are going
to march to Fez. Don’t forget it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac sat down, took off his cap, lit
a cigarette and drew up his chair to the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a serious one,” he said very sagely, “a
fastidious, serious one. When you look at me I feel
that you are very sorry for me—that poor Gerard—and
that you know I can’t help it. And when there
are Generals about, I point to you and say loudly: ‘Ah,
there is a serious one who will go far!’ But here
privately I am afraid for you, Paul. I say to myself,
‘He is not of stone. Some day things will happen
with that serious one, and where we common people
scrape our shins, he will break his neck. When we
amuse ourselves for a month, he will marry the Sergeant-Major’s
daughter.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul had heard this homily a good many times before.
He just went on writing as if his friend were
not in the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am not sure that something has not already
happened to you—oh, a long time ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul’s pen stopped abruptly, but he did not look up
from the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you not sure?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you have compassions and sympathies and
little delicacies of thought which the rest of us have
not. The garrisons of the Colonial army and the
coast towns of North Africa are not the natural soil
for such harvests. Some long time ago, a thing has
happened, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Paul. He gathered his papers together
and got up. Gerard was beginning to guess a little
too shrewdly. “But I will tell you what is going to
happen. I am going with you to the Villa Iris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nine years which had passed since Paul had
listened through an evening to Colonel Vanderfelt had
written less upon his face than on his character. He
hardly looked older, nor had he lost the elusive grace
which made others warm to him from the outset of
acquaintanceship. But he had now the ease, the restful
quality of a man who has found himself. Youth
which is solitary is given to luxuriate in woe, but the
years of companionship, of friendly rivalry, of strenuous
effort, and a little trifle of achievement had enabled
Paul Ravenel to contemplate the blot upon his name
with a much less tragic eye than when it had first
been revealed to him. He had hurried from Colonel
Vanderfelt’s house to France and for a week had
roamed the woods of Fontainebleau sunk in such an
exaggeration of shame that he shunned all speech and
company and felt himself a leper. Paul remembered
that week now with amazement and scorn. He had
served throughout the Chaiouïa Campaign, from the
capture of Settat, right on to the wonderful three
weeks in March when with the speed and the mobility
of Stonewall Jackson’s “foot-cavalry” they had
marched and fought and straightway marched again
until the swift pounce upon the great camp of Bou
Nuallah had put the seal upon their victories. Settat,
M’Kown, Sidi el Mekhi, the R’Fakha, the M’Karto—those
had been royal days of friendship and battle,
and endurance, and the memory of the week at Fontainebleau
could only live in shame beside them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac’s careless words had suddenly
set Paul upon this train of thought, so that he forgot
for a moment his friend’s presence in the room. He
had not changed his plans—he found himself putting
that question silently. No, he still meant to go back
to his own home and race and name. He was not of
those to whom Eastern lands and Eastern climes make
so searching an appeal that they can never afterwards
be happy anywhere else. He was a true child of the
grey skies, and he meant in due time to live under
them. But the actual date for that migration had
been pushed off to a misty day. He put his cap on his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, let us sample your Villa Iris,” he said; and
the two friends walked across Casablanca to the green,
dark-shuttered house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bar was full and the piano doing its worst.
Above the babel of voices, every harsh note of it hurt
like a tap upon a live brain. Paul and Gerard de
Montignac were the only two in uniform there that
night. A few small officials of the French business
companies, Greeks, Italians, nondescripts from the
Levant, and Jews, who three years before, paddling
barefoot in the filth of their Mellah, were the only
people to shout “Vive la France,” as the troops
marched through Casablanca—these made up the company
of the Villa Iris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac looked about the room. At a
big table at the end, a little crowd of these revellers,
dandies in broadcloth and yellow, buttoned boots, were
raising a din as they drank, some standing and gesticulating,
others perched on high stools, and all talking
at the top of their high, shrill voices. Half-a-dozen
women in bedraggled costumes covered with spangles
which had once done duty in the outlying Music Halls
of Paris were dancing with their partners in front of
the tables. But Gerard could not believe that any one
of them could have cost even little Boutreau of the
Legion five minutes of his ordinary ration of sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She may be outside,” said Gerard. “Let us see!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made his way between the tables, crossed the
open space of floor and went out through the wide
doorway on the big verandah. Paul followed him.
The verandah was almost empty. They sat down at
one of the small iron tables near to the garden, and
Gerard de Montignac broke into a laugh as he noticed
his friend’s troubled face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot bear it, eh? It is all too vulgar and
noisy and crude. You are sorry for us who are
amused by it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul laughed and his face cleared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be an idiot, Gerard. It isn’t that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look of perplexity returned to Ravenel’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen her,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seen whom?” asked Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Marguerite Lambert. At least, I think so.
It must have been she.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a real note of distress in Paul’s voice
which Gerard de Montignac was quite at a loss to
understand. He turned in his chair and looked into
the saloon. Between the doorway and the tables a few
couples were revolving, but the women were of the
type native to such places, their countenances plastered
with paint, a fixed smile upon their lips, and a deliberate
archness in their expression, and in their features
the haggard remains of what even at its bloom
so many years ago could have been no more than a
vulgar comeliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is sitting at the big table with those half-drunken
Levantines,” said Paul. “What is she doing
amongst them?” He asked the question in a voice of
bewilderment and pity. “Why is she here at all—a
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly the hard uproar of the piano ceased, the
dancers stopped their gyrations, with the abruptness of
mechanical figures whose works have run down, and
sauntered to their chairs. Gerard could now see the
big table but there was such a cluster of men about it,
gesticulating and shouting, that Gerard de Montignac
was moved to disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for those men we fight and get killed,” he
cried, turning towards Paul. “Look at them! Three
years ago they were cringing in their Mellahs or shivering
in their little shops and offices for fear of an
attack upon the city. Now they are the bloods of the
town, picking up the money all day, and living the
Life at night. Another three years and half of them
will have their automobiles and take supper at the
Café de Paris, whilst you and I, Paul, if we are lucky,
will be shaking with fever in some garrison in the
desert. I should like to bang their noisy heads together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul laughed at his friend’s indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All wars fatten the carrion birds, but it isn’t for
the carrion birds that they are fought,” he said, and
in the saloon all the voices ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac swung round again in his
chair. The men who had been standing about the big
table had taken their seats and on the far side of it,
almost facing the doorway and the two officers beyond
in the dark of the verandah, a girl was standing.
Gerard uttered a little cry, so startled was he by her
aspect, by the sharp contrast between her delicacy and
the squalor of her company. He heard Paul Ravenel
move behind him, but he did not turn. His eyes were
drawn to that slight figure and held by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite Lambert,” he whispered to himself.
There she stood, looking straight out through the
doorway towards them. Could she see them, he wondered.
Why was she standing there in view before
that crowd, in this dustbin of Casablanca? It was
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The piano sounded a note and Marguerite Lambert
began to sing. But she could not sing—that was
evident from the first bar. A tiny voice, which even
in that silence hardly reached to the two men on the
verandah, clear and gentle but with no range of music
in it. It was like a child singing and an untrained
child without any gift for singing. As singing it was
ridiculous. Yet Gerard de Montignac neither laughed,
nor could withdraw his eyes. He even held his breath,
and of her singing he was altogether unaware.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was pretty—yes, but too thin, and with eyes
unnaturally large for her face. She was fresh: yes,
strangely fresh for that place of squalor and withered
flowers. And she was young, so that she stood apart
from the other women like a jewel amongst pebbles.
But it was not her beauty which arrested him, nor some
indefinable air of good breeding which she had, but—and
when she was halfway through her little song
Gerard reached the explanation in his analysis—a
queer look of fatality. Yes, a fatal look as though
she was predestined to something out of the common,
greater joys perhaps or greater sufferings, a bigger
destiny than falls to the ordinary lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac had all the Frenchman’s passion
for classing people in their proper categories, and
his knack, as soon as that was done, of losing all interest
in them. He was unable to place the girl in hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was she singing about in that absurd little
tinkling voice? Moonlight, and lovers, and lilies on
the water? To a lot of degenerate money-grubbing
Levantines? Through Gerard’s memory, to the tune
which she sang was running a chain of names—names
of places—names which Commandant Marnier had
savagely strung together one night in the Mess; the
names of the stages in that melancholy pilgrimage
from which women do not return. Paris, Madrid,
Barcelona, Toulon, Marseilles, Oran, Tangiers, Casablanca,
and the Advanced Posts of the Legion. Yes,
but the pilgrimage occupied a lifetime. What was this
girl’s age? Was she nineteen or twenty? Not more,
assuredly! How then had she come to the penultimate
stage so soon? By what desperate circumstance of
crime or ill-fortune? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The song ceased and at once the clatter of voices
broke out again. Madame Delagrange behind her bar
poured out the drinks for three or four dark-skinned
waiters dressed like Turks and a painted woman with
worn eyes and wrinkles which no paint could hide
minced out in her shabby, high-heeled dancing slippers
to the officers on the verandah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me something to drink, dearie—I am dying
of thirst,” she said, and she drew a chair to their table.
Gerard de Montignac laughed brutally and would
have driven her away, but Paul was quick to anticipate
him. He had seen the woman flush under her paint
when Gerard laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he said at once. “What shall we all
drink, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to him gratefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will take my advice, the whiskey. The
champagne—oh, never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can imagine it,” said Paul. “Chiefly sugar and
sulphuric acid and mixed in the back yard,” and he
laughed pleasantly to put the woman at her ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The one sure gain which had come to Paul from the
destruction of his illusions was a hesitation in passing
judgment upon people and estimating their values
and characters. He had been so utterly mistaken once.
He meant to go gently thereafter. And partly for that
reason, partly because of an imagination which made
him always want to stand behind the eyes of others and
see what different things they looked out upon, from
the things which he saw himself, there had grown up
within that compassion and sympathy which Gerard
de Montignac had noticed as dangerous qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So although in truth he was more impatient than
Gerard that this woman should be gone, he betrayed
no sign of it. She had surely humiliations enough
each day without his adding yet another. Accordingly
they sat about the table, and the woman began with
the usual gambit of her class in the only game which
she knew how to play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not seen you here before. You have just
arrived in Casablanca, too—a few days ago? My
name is Henriette. Only to think that a fortnight ago
I was dining in the Café de Paris! But I wanted a
change—so fatiguing, Paris!—and to pay my expenses
meanwhile. So I dance here for a few weeks
and return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul accepted the outrageous lie with a fine courtesy
which was lost upon his friend, who for his part
grinned openly, remembering the Commandant Marnier’s
descriptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is that little one, Marguerite Lambert,
at her age and with her looks, doing here at the Villa
Iris?” he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette flushed and her eyes grew as hard as buttons.
“And why shouldn’t she be here?” she asked
with a resentful challenge. “Just like the rest of us!
Or do you think her so different as those idiots do
over at the table there? But I will tell you one thing,”
and she nodded her head emphatically. “She will not
be here long—no, nor anywhere else, the little fool!
But, there!—” Henriette’s anger died away as quickly
as it had flared up. “She is not a bad sort and quite
friendly with us girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why will she not stay here long?” asked
Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ask her yourself, if you are so curious,” she
cried impatiently. “But you are dull, you two! No,
you are not amusing me at all,” and, emptying her
glass, Henriette flung off into the saloon as the accompanist
began once more to belabour the keys of the
piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard watched her go with a shrug of the shoulders
and a laugh. He turned then towards Paul and Paul’s
chair was empty. Paul had risen the moment Henriette
had flung away and was walking at the back of
the tables towards the doorway into the Bar. Gerard
watched him curiously and with a certain malicious
amusement. Was he, too—that serious one—to go at
last the way of all flesh? To seek the conventional
compensation for a long period of strenuous service in
the facile amours of the coast towns?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beginning of the affair, at all events, was not
conventional. Gerard noticed, with a curious envy
which he had not thought to feel, that Paul Ravenel
went quietly to the back of that noisy table in the Bar,
and stood just behind Marguerite Lambert. No one at
the table noticed him nor did Marguerite turn. But she
rose slowly to her feet, like a person in a dream. Only
then did the men drinking at the table look toward
Paul Ravenel. A strange silence fell upon them, as
Marguerite turned about and went towards Paul. For
a moment they stood facing one another. Then Marguerite
fell in at his side, as though an order had
been given and they moved away from the group at
the table, slowly, like people alone, quite alone in an
empty world. And no word had been spoken by either
of them to the other, nor did either of them smile;
and their hands did not touch. But as they reached
the open floor where a few were dancing, Marguerite
glanced quickly, and to Gerard’s fancy, with fear, at
the fat woman behind the Bar; and then she spoke.
There was no doubt what she was saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better dance for a few moments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took her in his arms, and they danced. Gerard
de Montignac rose and went out of the Villa Iris. The
picture of the meeting between those two was still
vivid before his eyes. It was as though an order had
been given and both without haste or question had
perfectly obeyed it.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch7'>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<h3>The Pilgrimage</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen</span> they reached the wide doorway they
slipped out onto the balcony. It was cool
here and quiet and there was no light except
that which came from the Bar. They sat down at a
table apart from the others and close to the garden.
A waiter followed them out quickly and looked at
Marguerite for an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I have a citronade?” she asked of Paul, and
he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me order for you, will you? A little supper
and some red wine. You are hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite looked at him swiftly and dropped her
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am hungry,” she said, and a smile slowly
trembled about her lips and then lit up her whole face.
“I have never admitted it before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hollows of her shoulders, the unnaturally bright,
large eyes burning in her thin face, and an air of lassitude
she had, told a story of starvation clearly enough.
But the visitors at the Villa Iris had not the compassion
nor the interest to read it, and Marguerite, for her
own reasons, had always been at pains that it should
not be read at all. Now, however, she smiled, glad of
Paul’s care, glad that he had seen at once with such
keen, sure eyes one of the things which were amiss
with her. Paul ordered some chicken and a salad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the waiter will be quick, won’t he?” she urged.
“Madame is not very content if we are idle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll speak to her,” he said lightly. “I’ll tell her that
she is not to worry you to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose half out of his chair, meaning to buy an
evening of rest for Marguerite Lambert from the old
harridan behind the Bar. A bottle of champagne
would no doubt be the price and there was no compulsion
upon them to drink it. But he was not yet
upon his feet when the girl reached out her hand and
caught his sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! Please!” she cried with a vehemence which
quite startled him. “If she sends for me, I have got
to go and you mustn’t say a word! Promise me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was in terror. Even now her eyes glanced affrightedly
towards the open doorway, already expecting
the appearance of her mistress. To the enigma
which the girl’s presence at all in the Villa Iris proposed
to Paul Ravenel, here was another added. Why
should she be so terrified of that red-faced, bustling
woman behind the Bar? After all, Marguerite Lambert—the
only delicate and fresh and young girl who
had danced there for a living—must mean custom to
Madame Delagrange; must be therefore a personage
to be considered, not a mere slave to be terrified and
driven! Why, then—? How, then—? And his
blood was hot at the mere thought of Marguerite’s
terror and subjection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he showed nothing of his anger, nothing of his
perplexity in his face. He was at pains to reassure her.
Let him not add to her fears and troubles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise, Marguerite,” he said. “But let’s hope
she doesn’t notice your absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more she smiled, her face a flame of tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You called me by my name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He repeated it, dwelling upon its syllables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a beautiful name,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, as you speak it,” she answered with a
laugh. “But wait till you hear how harsh a word
Madame can make of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter brought the supper and laid it on the
table between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eat and drink first,” said Paul Ravenel, as he
poured the red wine into her glass. “Then we will
talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall tell me your name before I begin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul—Paul Ravenel,” said he, and she repeated
the name once with her big, serious eyes fixed upon
him and a second time with a little grimace which
wrinkled up her nose and gave to her whole face a
flash of gaiety. She drew her chair to the table with
an anticipation and relish which filled Paul with pity
and tugged sharply at the strings of his heart. She ate
her supper with enjoyment and daintiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cigarette?” said Paul, offering her his case as
soon as she had finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you! Oh, but I was hungry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lit it and leaning back in her chair smoked
whilst the waiter cleared the supper away and set the
bottle and the glasses between them on the table.
Then Marguerite leaned forward, her face between her
hands, her elbows on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul!” she said with a smile, as if the name was a
fruit and delightful to taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you,” she continued in a low voice, “when
you first came into the room, you and your friend. I
thought at once that you would come for me as you
did. I called to you—yes, even then—oh, with all
my strength—quietly—to myself. But I called so earnestly
that I was afraid that I had cried my little
prayer out loud. And then when I lost sight of you
out here in the dark I was afraid. I didn’t see you
come in again. I only knew suddenly that you were
standing behind me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel watched her as she spoke, her great
eyes shining, her face delicately white in that dim
light. He had no doubt that she spoke in all frankness
and simplicity the truth. Were they not once
more alone, shut off by a wall of dreams from all the
world? Paul leaned forward and took her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not need to hear you call, Marguerite. I
saw you, too, at once. My friend had heard of you,
was looking for you. I saw you. I told him where
you were”; and for a moment the girl’s face clouded
over and the spell was broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far Paul Ravenel had spoken in French. Now
he asked in English:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do they call you the American?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite Lambert stared at him with her eyes
opened wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We are of the same race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at his uniform.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My mother was French, my father English. He
took my mother’s nationality,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite suddenly stretched both her hands across
the table to him in a swift abandonment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad,” she said. “I come from Devonshire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I from Sussex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I from the county of broad moors and little valleys.
You from—”; and some look upon his face
checked her suddenly. “I have said something that
hurts?” she asked remorsefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Paul, and for a few moments they
were silent. To both of them this revelation that they
were of the same race was no longer so much of a
surprise as a portent. They were like travellers not
quite sure that their feet were on their due appointed
road, who come upon a sign post and know that they
have made no mistake. These two had no doubt that
they were upon their road of destiny, that this swift,
unexpected friendship would lead them together into
new countries where their lives would be fulfilled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just to imagine if I had never come to the Villa
Iris!” Paul exclaimed with a gasp of fear; so near
he had been to not coming. But Marguerite’s eyelids
drooped over her eyes and a look of doubt and sadness
shadowed her face. Exaltations and hopes—here
were bright things she dared hardly look upon, for if
she once looked and took them to her heart, and
found them false, what was merely grievous would no
longer be endurable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a long way from Devonshire to Casablanca,”
cried Paul, and Marguerite smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a question very prettily put,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her story was ordinary enough in its essentials.
“Some families go up,” she said simply. “Others
seem doomed to go right down and bring every member
of them down too. Most English villages have an
example, I think. Once and not so long ago they
were well off and lived in their farm house. Now
every descendant is a labourer in a cottage, except one
or two perhaps who have emigrated and fared no
better abroad. The Lamberts were like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had been born when the family were
more than half way down the hill, although outwardly
it still showed prosperous. Her father, a widower,
spent more of his time upon race-courses than upon
his farm and made it a point of pride to educate his
children in the fashionable and expensive schools.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was the most happy-go-lucky man that ever
lived,” said Marguerite. “We knew nothing of the
debts or the mortgages. He was all for being a gentleman
and to be a gentleman in his definition was to
spend money. He came down to breakfast one morning—there
were the four of us at home, my brother,
my two sisters and myself, and said cheerily, ‘Well,
girls, all the money’s gone and the farm, too.’ Then
he ate his breakfast cheerily, went upstairs and blew
out his brains with his shot-gun, I suppose quite cheerily,
too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The catastrophe had happened a little more than two
years before, when Marguerite was between seventeen
and eighteen. Misfortune scatters a family as a wind
autumn leaves. The brother, a small replica of his
father, departed for the Argentine, cheerily confident
of rebuilding by an opportune speculation the Lambert
fortune; the eldest of the sisters married an unsuccessful
farmer in the neighbourhood with whom
she was in love; the second became a private secretary,
lost her job within the week, and discovered her
proper sphere of work, as a pretty waitress in a tea-shop.
Marguerite herself secured an engagement in
the chorus of a Musical Comedy company which was
touring the provinces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were just ordinary girls,” Marguerite continued,
“rather fecklessly brought up, fairly good-looking,
decent manners, but nothing outstanding. There
wasn’t any Edna May amongst us. We just did what
we could, not very well.” Marguerite suddenly broke
into a delicious laugh. “You heard me sing, didn’t
you? Pathetic, wasn’t it? At least it would have
been if I hadn’t felt the humour of it all the while.
Well, we got stranded in Wigan—I am speaking of
my Musical Comedy company. I pawned a few things
and travelled to London. Three of the chorus girls
and I clubbed together and got lodgings in Bloomsbury.
But it was October when the most of the touring
companies had already gone out and fresh engagements
were only probable for the Christmas pantomime.
One after another of my companions dropped
away. Finally I was offered an opening in a concert
party which was to tour the music halls in France. I
was to dance between the songs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A concert party!” said Paul. “That sounds doubtful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was warned against it. The White Slave traffic!
But I had to take my risk. And as it happened there
wasn’t any roguery of that kind. Our concert party
was genuine. Only it didn’t attract and at Avignon
it came to an end. There seems to me to be a curse
on families going down hill. Misfortunes centre upon
them. It is as though a decent world wanted to hurry
them right down and comfortably out of sight as soon
as possible, so that it might no longer feel the shame of
them.” Marguerite laughed, not so much in bitterness
as in submission to a law. “Perhaps it is simply
that we who belong to those families don’t will hard
enough that things should go right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel looked sharply at his companion. He
had instances within his own knowledge to bear out the
shrewdness of her remark. His father and Colonel
Vanderfelt! What difference was there between them,
except that one willed hard enough to atone for a
crime and the other did not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I expect that’s the truth, if you are started
down hill,” he said slowly. “And then what did you
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a great fear in his heart as to what her
answer might be. He was already making excuses—already
arguing why should there be one law for the
man and another for the woman—and rebelling against
the argument. Marguerite did not resolve his fears in
her account of her miserable little Odyssey; nor, on
the other hand, did she increase them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had enough money to take me to Marseilles.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I danced at a café there for a little while. I was told
that if I crossed the Mediterranean to Oran .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
managed to do that and I danced at Oran for a little
while. Then I came on to Casablanca,” and she caught
her breath and clasped her hands convulsively under
the sting of some ever-present terror. “And I am
afraid,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what?” asked Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I shall not stay here long, either,” she cried
in a dreadful note of despair, with her great eyes suddenly
full of tears. “Then what shall I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as she spoke that question her face changed.
Some one was coming out from the Bar through the
doorway. A smile of convention upon her lips masked
her misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have to go now, Paul,” she said in a low
voice, caressing his name. “I am sorry. And you will
let me go, as you promised?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Paul regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you will come here again, some evening, soon,
Paul!” she whispered with a wistful little smile upon
her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall wait now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile disappeared at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I must dance now. I told you Madame did
not like to see me idle. I shall not be able to sit with
you again this evening, and we do not close until two
or three in the morning, if there is any one to stay.
So to-morrow, perhaps, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood up as a man approached the table. He
was a thick-set, stoutish man with a heavy black moustache
and a yellowish, shiny face. He was one of
those who had been seated at the table in the saloon
with Marguerite when Ravenel and Gerard de Montignac
had entered the room. He came up with a
frown upon his face and spoke surlily in French, with
a harsh, metallic accent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We wait a long time for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite Lambert made no rejoinder. “You wish
me to dance with you,” she said. “I am very happy,”
and with a smile of convention upon her lips she said
good-night carelessly to Paul Ravenel. But the appeal
and softness of her eyes took the convention out
of her smile and the carelessness from her farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul, left alone at the table, watched her through
the doorway as she danced. Her little plain pink
frock was as neat as attention could make it, her shoes
and stockings were spotless, her hair, brown with a
flicker of copper, parted at the side and with a curiously
attractive little peak in the centre of her forehead,
was waved smoothly about her small head. His
hands had been tingling to stroke it, to feel its silk and
warmth rippling beneath his fingers, whilst they had
been sitting together on the balcony. There was a
slovenliness in the aspect of the other women. Marguerite
was orderly as though even amidst the squalor
of her environment she kept on respecting herself.
She wore no ornaments at all. She was fairly tall,
with slim legs and beautiful hands and feet. As he
watched her Paul fell into a cold and bitter rage against
the oily-mustachioed creature with whom she danced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gerard was right,” he said to himself. “We go
out and fight, we get ourselves killed and mutilated,
so that such fellows may make money and keep it up
all night in the Bars. The Profiteers! We who are
about to die salute you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he apostrophised the man who had taken Marguerite
Lambert away from him, raging furiously.
The old prudent Paul Ravenel counting his steps and
avoiding emotions, had for the moment quite disappeared.
He was a boy of nineteen, ardent and unreasonable,
and a little ridiculous in the magniloquence
of his thoughts. The only comfort he drew was from
an aloofness in Marguerite of which she had shown
nothing whilst she sat with him, but which was now
very evident. She did not speak whilst she danced,
her eyelids were lowered, her face had lost all its expression.
Paul had a fancy that she had just left her
body to revolve and glide delicately in the dance, whilst
her spirit had withdrawn itself into some untarnished
home of its own. The piano suddenly was dumb; the
dancers stopped: Marguerite and her partner were
standing face to face in front of the doorway. Paul
had promised not to interfere. Very well then, he
would go. He rose abruptly to his feet, his eyes fixed
upon the couple; and at once, though Marguerite never
looked his way, she moved sharply. It was a quick
little start, hardly perceptible. Paul felt a wave of
joy sweep over him. She was conscious of him, as he
was conscious of her, so that if he moved abruptly she
at a distance was startled. He turned with a smile
upon his lips, but after all he did not go, as he had
intended to do. For Henriette came out of the Bar
towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you stay for a minute,” she said, “and give
me something to drink! I am dying of thirst!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” he said, and he called to the waiter.
He had a great goodwill towards all women that
night, but above all to the women of the Villa Iris.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<h3>Henriette Explains</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>P</span>aul</span> was rewarded out of all measure for his
courtesy. For as Henriette sat and drank her
whiskey and soda, she talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were civil to me when your friend would have
sent me contemptuously away,” she said. “And when
I told you that I had dined at the Café de Paris only
three weeks ago, and your friend laughed, you did not.
You pretended that you believed it. That was polite
of you. For we both knew that never once in all my
life have I dined at the Café de Paris or any such swell
restaurant in Paris. And it was kind of you. It made
me ready to fancy that I had dined there and that
does one a little good, eh? One feels better in one’s
self. So I will be kind in my turn. You are interested
in that little one,” and she jerked her head towards
the table in the Bar, where Marguerite had rejoined
the noisy group. “Yes, she has chic, and she
is pretty on her feet, and she has a personality, but—”
Paul Ravenel leaned forward, his face hardening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle, I do not want to hear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am not going to crab her,” replied Henriette,
and her petulant temper flamed up. “You think, I
suppose, that women cannot admire a girl who is
younger and prettier than themselves and cannot like
her. That is foolish. I tell you we all like Marguerite
Lambert. And I speak to you for your good
and hers. But, of course, if you do not care to hear
me—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle,” said Paul. “I
will listen to you very willingly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette’s passions were no more than bubbles upon
the surface of her good-humour. They burst very
quickly and left no traces. The flush faded from her
throat and forehead and no doubt from the painted
cheeks as well, though that could not be discovered by
mortal eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” she said. “Your friend asked me what
Marguerite Lambert was doing at the Villa Iris, and
I would not answer him. Why should I? It was
clear what he meant, wasn’t it? Why was she, who
might really have dined at the Café de Paris three
weeks ago, already here at Casablanca, so near to the
end of things?” Henriette’s face grew for a moment
haggard with terror, as she formulated the problem.
The last stage but one of the dreadful pilgrimage of her
class! She herself was making that journey, and what
lay beyond and so hideously close, loomed up when she
thought of it, and appalled her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul interrupted her with a word of solace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are making too much of his question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Henriette would have none of his consolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that is what he meant and what you meant,
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the question was in your face. The question
and a great deal of trouble. Why was Marguerite
Lambert already at Casablanca?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul did not contradict her again. She would not
believe him if he did and he might lose the answer to
the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You made it still more difficult to understand,” he
said frankly. There was no good to be gained by beating
about the bush with this woman who was disposed
to help him. “For though you didn’t answer our question
you added to it another perplexity. You said that
she wouldn’t remain here long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is right. The answer to both questions is the
same. She drifted here so soon, and she will stay for
so short a time, because she waits for the grand passion.
Yes, the little fool!” but it was not in scorn
that she styled Marguerite a little fool, but with a half-contemptuous
tenderness, and perhaps a tiny spite of
envy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The grand passion!” Paul repeated, wondering
what in the world his companion meant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Oh, she is quite frank with the rest of us.
We talk, you know, when we are dressing, and after
the café is closed, when we are changing back to our
street clothes. Until the grand passion comes, nothing,
nothing, nothing to any man. Look, they are
dancing again, she and Petras Tetarnis, the Greek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he was a Greek, the man with the yellow-buttoned
boots and the heavy black moustache! Henriette
watched them with the eye of a professional.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she dances prettily, that little one. But would
you like a girl to dance with you just in that way—so
unconcerned, so half-asleep, so utterly indifferent to
you? And if you wanted her as Petras Tetarnis does,
furiously, wouldn’t you be mad when she swam in
your arms so lightly, with so correct a grace and not
one look or smile or thought for you? So that if you
spoke to her, she had to recall her thoughts from the
end of the world before she could answer you? You
would be wild with rage, eh? You would want to
take that slim little white throat between your two
big hands and squeeze and squeeze until some attention
was paid to you, if it was only the attention of
agony and fear. Am I not right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul’s face turned white. He leaned across the
table and cried in a low, fierce voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that what you meant, Henriette, when you
said that she would not be here long? That the Greek
would murder her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette burst into a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, no, no, my friend. Petras Tetarnis is not
the man to run such perils. He has made much money,
since the French have come to Casablanca. He is a
prudent one. It would have to be a very dark night
and a very empty street before Tetarnis risked his
beautiful money and all the enjoyment he gets from
it; and even then some one else would have to do the
work. But he will use other ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of ways?” asked Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is always here. He is rich. Madame Delagrange
makes much of him. Very likely he has lent
her money, and if so, he will want his interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul leaned back in his chair and Henriette looked
at him curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were much moved, my friend, when I spoke of
the big, coarse hands gripping that little throat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, any man would be, and whoever the woman,”
he protested, and Henriette smiled her disbelief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you have been so moved if it had been my
throat which you thought to be in danger?” she asked
shrewdly. “No! Let us be frank. You would have
said, ‘It is Henriette’s business to look after herself.
She is old enough, anyway’; and you would have forgotten
me the next moment.” She turned her eyes
again upon Marguerite Lambert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The grand passion. Oh, la, la, la! Until it comes
nothing, oh, but nothing at all for any one—not half
a heart beat! But when it does come, everything, at
once, with both hands. The folly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The glorious imprudence!” replied Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette broke into a harsh laugh as she heard the
softly spoken words and saw the light in Paul Ravenel’s
eyes. It was the light of a great relief rather
than of hope. The fear which had plagued him all
through this evening had gone now. There was no
need for the excuses. He had not to argue a defence
for Marguerite Lambert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The glorious imprudence,” Henriette repeated with
a sneer. “Yes, so you say—you, the man who has
everything to gain from the glorious imprudence and
when he is tired of it, can drop it in the road behind
him. But I tell you those are not good ideas for a girl
who dances for her living, in the cafés. There is the
patron behind the patron like Petras Tetarnis, who
will make trouble if he doesn’t get what he wants, for
there are rich patrons whom the patron does not wish
to drive away. Or there are jealousies which may
mean fighting and the police. No, my fine gentleman!
Girls who are difficult, the Villa Irises are no place for
them. That is why Marguerite Lambert at twenty is
dancing in Casablanca and will not dance there
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if the great passion comes?” cried Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it must come quick! Believe me, very quick.
Petras Tetarnis is growing troublesome. And if it
comes! Shall I tell you what will happen? She will
blow her brains out! Oh, you may start in your chair.
But look at her where she sits! There is the mark of
fate already upon her face. It is written, as they say
in this country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So to Henriette as to Gerard de Montignac and to
Paul Ravenel, that indefinable look of destiny in Marguerite
was evident. Paul asked himself whether it
was not simply the outward and visible sign of that
passionate self-respect which had kept her untarnished
against the rush and play of the great passion when it
came. Or was the future really written there—a history
of great joys perhaps and great sorrows certainly
to be?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Marguerite lives on seven francs a day and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got no further. Paul interrupted her with an
exclamation of horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seven francs!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That is what our generous Madame Delagrange
pays us each night and we provide our own
dancing kit out of it. Oh, the little fool starves. That
is certain—all the more certain because she will not
let any of the clients here give her food.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she let me,” cried Paul with a smile of pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she let you to-night. But the others, never,
never, lest—you understand? Lest they should make
a claim.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of so small a service?” asked Paul incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been lucky in your world,” she said.
“The clients of the Villa Iris are not so generous.
They will make a claim out of anything, as, by the
way, most men will, if the claim may get them what
they want. So that little one, since she will give herself
to none of them, is wise to starve. You are the
only one from whom she has taken food. It is curious,
eh? It is because of that and because you treat me
like a human being that I, Henriette, who like the
little fool, ramble on so seriously to you to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The plastered face softened into tenderness and the
bird-like eyes shone and filled suddenly with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is kind of you,” said Paul. If any one had said
to him a couple of hours before that he would have
felt himself intensely privileged because a little dancing
girl of the Villa Iris had taken supper from him
and from him alone, he would have laughed his informant
to scorn. But it was so. Paul was radiant
with pride. He saw himself as a very fine fellow, a
much finer fellow than he had ever believed himself
to be. The loneliness of his boyhood, a sudden blow
crushing his pride and his dreams in the dust, and
years thereafter informed with a strong purpose to
regain his name and his place in his own country, had
combined to defer but had not slain his youth. It was
back with him now, all the more ardent and dangerous
from the restraint which had held it in check. Paul
Ravenel was a boy of nineteen on this evening in the
fire of his passion, but with the will and the experience
of his own years; and he was old enough to hide any
plans which he might be forming and to seek all the
knowledge he could get from Henriette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should she blow out her brains, as you say?”
he asked, offering to Henriette a cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because that is what she will do,” replied Henriette
as she lighted her cigarette. “I know my world.
Listen! My father kept a little eating-house at Rouen,
where I saw many types of men. He went bankrupt.
I went to dance in Paris. Oh, I was nothing out of
the way. I danced in a quadrille at the Casino de
Paris for a little time, then at the Bal Tabarin. I
went to Madrid and Barcelona where I danced at the
Lion d’Or, the restaurant which has no doors, for it
is open night and day. And in the end I came here.
Well, I tell you this. Fine dreams are for rich people.
For us, if we are wise, we bury them out of sight the
moment they are born. We will not think of them.
We will not allow them. The rich have much which
makes disappointment bearable. For us—we blow our
brains out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst she spoke she kept darting little swift glances
at her companion, as though she was practising on him
some trivial diplomacy. She believed, in truth, every
word she said. But since her philosophy was not
Marguerite’s, if this man could give the girl a year or
two of happiness, it would be something, at all events.
But Paul sat and listened carelessly and answered not
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See!” she cried. “When you spin the racquet for
the choice of courts at the tennis, it is ‘rough’ or
‘smooth,’ eh? Well, it is always rough with us and
we lose the choice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed at her trifle of a joke, and again her
eyes glanced at Paul. But the clearer his purpose became
to himself, the more impassive grew his face.
Long ago he had learnt that lesson of defence. Henriette
rose. She, at all events, was openly disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So! I have talked to you long enough,” she said.
The piano began once more its dreadful cacophany.
“Ah, Marguerite is dancing with another of that band.
He does not matter. You yourself will dance with her
again to-night, isn’t it so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and as he saw Henriette’s face cloud over,
he added, “she herself bade me keep away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cloud passed at once. That was good news.
There was an understanding between them, then, already.
Henriette beamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand that,” she said in a whisper, “and I
hope you understand it, too. Madame Delagrange is
not very content that we dance much with the officers.
She says they have no money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul laughed. He would have loved to have seen
Gerard de Montignac’s face if that remark had been
made before him and to have heard his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much, certainly, as those gentlemen over
there whom we have made rich. But enough, Mademoiselle
Henriette, to thank a good friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment Henriette was puzzled. Then she
looked down. Beside her empty glass lay a folded
slip of paper. The broad band of purple told her the
amount of the bank note. She leaned forward and
spoke in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thousand francs! It is a fortune to me! You
understand that? I will take it, yes, with a thousand
thanks, but it was not to get your money that I spoke
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought it. If I had thought it, your surprise
would have proved me wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette gathered the note in the palm of her hand
and making a movement as if to take her handkerchief,
slipped it secretly into her bosom. Another thought
came to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are really rich then! You could make a little
home, a little safe home, where there would be no
clients or patrons or starving. Oh, that would be different!”
she said in a wondering voice. “I take back
what I said about the end her grand passion would
lead her to.” Henriette glanced again towards Marguerite.
“She is chic, eh? She has style, the little
one? An air of good breeding. Whence does it
come? How is it that she has kept it?” Paul could
have answered that question had he wished to. She
had kept it because of her immense pride and self-respect,
she had probably got it to keep, from the same
source. Henriette looked from the girl dancing to
the officer at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little home, eh. If it could be!” she pleaded.
Paul gazed at her with a smile upon his lips and in his
eyes, but he did not answer her, and she flung away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you are a box with the lid shut! Good-night,
Monsieur!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Mademoiselle Henriette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few moments later Paul Ravenel followed Henriette
into the Bar. He stopped before the counter
where Madame Delagrange was vigorously wiping the
wet rings made by the bottoms of the glasses from the
light polished wood. She had always the duster in
her hand, except when she was measuring out her
drinks into the glasses, and very often then, and generally
was at work with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is quite Maxim’s, Madam,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flattery had little effect. Madame barely paused
in her polishing and smiled sourly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In that case I must see about raising my prices,
Monsieur,” said she. No, clearly she did not like the
officers. Paul went on to the door. Marguerite, seated
with the Levantines, never looked at him, but just as
he was going out she raised her glass to her lips with
a little nod of her head, as though she drank a health
to some absent friend, and her slow smile dawned and
trembled on her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the night was not yet over for Paul Ravenel.
As he reached his house he heard his name called aloud
and turning about saw his friend Gerard de Montignac
hurrying towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is news at last,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The town had been full of rumours for many days.
Certain things were known. It was certain, for instance
that the tribes of the Beni-M’Tir, the Ait-Youssi
and the Gerouan had actually pitched their tents on
the plain of Fez and in full revolt against Mulai Hafid
the Sultan, were pressing the city close. It was known
too that a flying column purposely small in order to
set at rest the distrust of the German Press and the
opposition of politicians in Paris, had been assembled
at Kenitra for a swift march to relieve the capital.
This had been delayed by bad weather which had turned
the flat country beyond Kenitra into a marsh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there had been for days a continual disembarkation
of fresh troops at Casablanca which pointed to
operations on a wider scale. On this night the truth
was out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come into the house and let me hear, Gerard,” said
Paul, and opening his door he switched on the electric
lights and led Gerard into a room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meknes has risen too. A new Sultan, Mulai Zine,
the brother of Mulai Hafid has been proclaimed Sultan
there. It is no longer to be a flying column which will
camp for a few days under the walls of Fez and return.
It is to be a great expedition. The whole camp at Ain-Bourdja
is ringing with it to-night. I ran down to tell
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was good of you, Gerard,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a great contrast visible now between the
two officers, the one excited and eager, the other playing
with the switch of the standard lamp upon his
table, and lost in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear that my squadron is to go up in the first
column under Colonel Brulard. You, of course, with
your battalion will be wanted too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so,” replied Paul slowly. “I should have
liked to have finished this report before I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The report can wait,” cried Gerard, “France can’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two friends talked late into the night. Paul
gradually threw off the reticence with which he had at
first answered De Montignac. They fell to debating
the strength of the different columns, the line of march,
whether through the forest of Zemmour or over the
plain of the Sebou and by the Col of Segota, and who
would command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brulard for the Advance Force,” said Gerard, “the
General himself will follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Gouraud?” asked Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, Gouraud. He couldn’t be left behind. It
is said that he will have the supply column and follow
a day or two behind Brulard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall know more about it to-morrow,” said
Paul, and Gerard looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know the time?” he said springing to his
feet. “If we were in France now, we should see daylight.”
He was in an emotional mood. He clapped
his friend upon the shoulder. “We shall see one another
again, my old one, before I start, no doubt. But
if we don’t, and anything happens to either of us, well,
it is good luck to the survivor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands with Paul and Paul let him out of
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul went back to the room. The eagerness with
which he had discussed the technical details of the expedition
fell from him as soon as he was alone. He
sat down at his table and remained there until dawn
at last did break over the town. But he was not at
work upon his report. He had pushed it from him
and sat with his face between the palms of his hands.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h3>Marguerite Lambert</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> rumours of the camp were proved true the
next morning and the preparations for provisioning
and concentrating so large a force
were swiftly pushed forward. Gerard de Montignac
was to march with his squadron in a week’s time by
Rabat and Saller to Kenitra. Paul was to rejoin his
battalion a few days later. Half of that battalion,
Paul’s company included, was to form part of the
escort of Colonel Gouraud’s huge supply column, which
with its hundreds of camels was beginning to assemble
at Meheydia at the mouth of the Sebou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul was now a full Captain in command of that
company of the Tirailleurs which he had led during
the last engagements of the Chaiouïa campaign, and
marked out by his superiors as an officer likely to reach
the high ranks and responsibilities. He had still a few
days of his leave and he spent the greater part of them
in the careful revision of his report. Gerard de Montignac,
on his side was engaged in the supervision of
the equipment of his squadron and was busy from
morning until night. Two or three times during the
course of the week, he went down between nine and
ten at night to the Villa Iris, and sat or danced for half
an hour with Marguerite Lambert. But he never saw
Paul Ravenel there and through the week the two
friends did not meet except for a moment or two in the
thronged streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Le grand serieux!” said Gerard, speaking of Paul
to Marguerite Lambert with an affectionate mockery.
“He will be a General when I am an old Major dyeing
my moustache to make myself look young. But meanwhile,
whilst we are both Captains, I should like to
see more of him than I do. For, after all, we go out
with our men—and one never knows who will come
back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite’s face lost its colour at his words and
she drew in her breath sharply. “Oh, it is our business
of course,” he continued, taking her sympathy to
himself. “Do you know, Marguerite, that for a second,
I though you had stirred that thick soup in Paul’s
veins which he calls his blood? But no, he never comes
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite laughed hurriedly, and asked at random,
“You have seen him to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He was coming out of a house close to the
port with the agent who looks after his property, a
little Italian. Paul was talking very earnestly and did
not notice me. He has a good deal of property in
Casablanca and was making his arrangements no
doubt for a long absence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite looked down at the table, tracing a pattern
upon its surface with her finger. When she spoke
again her voice broke upon her words and her lips
quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall lose all my friends this week,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only us two,” said Gerard, consoling her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what I mean,” she returned with a little
smile, and Gerard de Montignac leaned forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, I don’t go for a couple of days,” he
said, lowering his voice to an eager whisper. “Let us
make the best of them! Let me have the memory of
two good days and nights to carry away with me, will
you? Why not? My work is done. I could start off
with my troops at six o’clock to-morrow instead of at
six o’clock on the third morning. Give me the next
two days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac knew nothing of that conversation
which Henriette had held with Paul Ravenel on
this spot a few nights before. He could but believe
that Marguerite Lambert somehow found that dreadful
gang of nondescripts with whom she foregathered
more to her taste than he or his friend. She shone
like a flower in this squalid haunt, a tired and drooping
flower. It was extraordinary that she could endure
this company for a moment, to say nothing of
their embraces. But women, even the most delicate
amongst them, would blindfold their eyes and stop their
ears, and cease to appreciate both the look of their
friends and the esteem in which they are held, if their
interest prompted them. Gerard de Montignac rose
angrily from his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course poor devils of officers like myself can’t
hope to compete with these rich Dagoes,” he said
brutally. “We must console ourselves with reflecting
that our efforts and dangers have made them rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite Lambert flushed scarlet at the insult, and
then lowered her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not wish to speak to you again,” she said in a
distinct low voice, and Gerard de Montignac stalked
out of the Villa Iris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was troubled by his recollection of the little
scene during the next two days; sometimes falling into
a remorse, and sometimes repeating his own words
with bravado, and arguing that this was the proper
way to speak; and always ending with a flood of heart-felt
curses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn all Dagoes and Levantines! There ought to
be a special code for them. They ought to be made to
take off their shoes when they meet us in the street.
Those old Moors knew something! I’ll never see that
girl again as long as I live. Luckily she’ll be gone by
the time I come back to Casablanca. Henriette said
she wouldn’t dance at the Villa Iris for long. No, I
won’t see her again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept carefully away from the neighbourhood of
the Villa for thirty-six hours. Then a post came in
and was delivered throughout the camp at eight o’clock
in the evening. Amongst the letters which Gerard de
Montignac received was one written in English by a
Colonel Vanderfelt in Sussex praying for news of
Paul Ravenel. Gerard had enough English to perceive
how much anxiety and affection had gone to the composition
of that letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ought to be answered at once,” he said. “Paul
must answer it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard looked at his watch. It was close upon nine
now, and he was to parade at six in the morning. He
must hand over that letter to Paul to-night. He could
have sent it by the post very well, or he could have
written an answer to Colonel Vanderfelt himself. But
he took up his cap instead and walked down from Ain-Bourdja
towards the town. Very likely he had some
unacknowledged purpose at the back of his mind. For
he found himself presently standing before the Villa
Iris, though that house lay well out of the road between
the camp and Paul Ravenel’s house by the seaward
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since I am here,” he said, as though he had
come to this spot quite by accident, “I may as well go
in and make my peace with Marguerite Lambert.
For all I know I may be quitting the world altogether
very shortly, and why should I leave unnecessary
enemies to hate my memory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus he explained quite satisfactorily to himself his
reason for entering and looking about him for Marguerite.
But she was nowhere to be seen—no, not
even amongst the Dagoes and the Levantines. She
must be outside in the cool of the balcony beneath the
roof of vines. But a glance there showed him that he
was wrong. There was nothing for it but to approach
the virago behind the Bar, who hotter and redder
than ever on this night in early May, was
polishing away at her counter and serving out the
drinks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard ordered one and taking it from her hand,
said carelessly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle Marguerite is not here to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Delagrange made a vicious dab with her
duster and cried in an exasperation:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, Monsieur! When she is here I have nothing
but complaints. That little Marguerite! She holds
her nose in the air as if we smelled. She looks at us
as if we were animals at a circus—and she has nothing
to be conceited about with her thin shoulders and
tired face. Now she is gone, it is all the time—‘What
have you done with our little Marguerite?’ Well, I
have done nothing.” She turned to another customer.
“For you, Monsieur? A bottle of champagne? Abdullah
shall bring it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abdullah in his Turkish breeches was handed the
dreadful decoction and Gerard de Montignac tried
again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has left the Villa Iris altogether?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes, yes. She has gone, that Miss Ni’Touche!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where has she gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The harridan behind the Bar flung up her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saperlipoppette, how should I know, I ask you?
I beg you, Monsieur, to allow me to serve my clients
who do not think that because they have bought a
whiskey-soda, they have become proprietors for the
night of the Villa Iris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an indignant nod she turned to some other
customers. Gerard wandered out into the verandah,
where he sat down rather heavily. He was more troubled
than he would have thought possible. After all
the disappearance of a little dancing girl from a Bar
in a coast town of Morocco!—what was there to make
a fuss about in that? That is the way of little dancing
girls. They dance and they disappear, a question or
two from you and me and the next man are as it were
the ripples upon the pond, and then the surface is still
once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerard de Montignac could not dismiss Marguerite
Lambert with this easy philosophy. He remembered
her too clearly, her slim grace, the promise
of real beauty if only she had food enough, her anger
with him two evenings ago, and above all the queer
look of fatality set upon her like a seal. Marguerite
Lambert gone! How and whither? One or two
dreadful sentences spoken a fortnight ago in the mess
by the Commandant Marnier were written in letters
of flame upon his memory. Casablanca was the last
halting place but one in the ghastly pilgrimage of these
poor creatures. The last of all—he shuddered to think
of it. To picture Marguerite Lambert amongst its
squalors was a sacrilege. Yet she had gone—she had
moved on! There was the appalling fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Henriette strolling a little way off between
the tables. He beckoned eagerly to her. She looked
at him doubtfully, then with a mutinous air and a toss
of the head she strolled towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to speak to me? You were not very polite
the last time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will atone for my discourtesy to-night, Mademoiselle
Henriette.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette was induced to take a chair and order a
drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard believed that he must practise some diplomacy
with this fiery creature if he was to get the truth
from her, but as a fact he had not to put one question.
For Henriette had hardly begun to sip her whiskey
and soda before she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little Marguerite! She has been sent away.
I am sorry. I told you—didn’t I?—that she wouldn’t
stay here long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sent away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Madame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. After all the guests had gone. But what a
scene! Oh, la, la, la! I was frightened I can tell you.
So were we all. We hid in the little room there off
the Bar, where we dress, and listened through the
crack of the door. But a scene! It was terrible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me!” said Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette twitched her chair into the table with an
actual excitement. She was really and deeply distressed
for Marguerite. But for the moment her distress
was forgotten. The joy of the story teller had
descended upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the Greek over there, Petras Tetarnis,” she
began. “He was mad for Marguerite and she wouldn’t
have anything to do with him. So he got her turned
away. See how drunk he is to-night. How proud of
his fine revenge on a little girl who asked for nothing
more than permission to earn her seven francs a night
in peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She wouldn’t have anything to say to him!” Gerard
protested. “Why, she was always at that table where
he sits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Because he is the real owner of the Villa
Iris. Madame is no more than his servant. So Marguerite,
since she wished to stay here, must be friendly
to him. But Petras was not content with friendliness
and last night when your friend came in—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend,” interrupted Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the one with the yellow hair and the long legs
and the face that tells you nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul! He was here last night!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Oh, he has come here more than once during
the last week, but very late and for a few minutes. He
goes straight to that table and takes Marguerite away,
as if he were the master; and somehow they all sit
dumb as if they were the lackeys. Imagine it, Monsieur!
All of them very noisy and boisterous and
then—a sudden silence and the yellow-headed Captain
walking away with Marguerite Lambert as if they did
not exist. It used to make the rest of us laugh, but
they—they were furious with humiliation and when, a
little time afterwards, the Captain had gone—oh, how
bold they were! They would pull his nose for him the
next time, they would teach him how gentlemen behave—oh,
yes, yes! But it was always the next time that
these fine lessons would be given.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the breed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette described how Paul Ravenel had entered
the Bar a little after midnight. He had taken Marguerite
Lambert away, danced a round or two, and
given her some supper; and whilst she ate, Petras
Tetarnis emboldened by drink and the encouragement
of his friends had left his table and begun to prowl
backwards and forwards behind Paul Ravenel’s back,
nodding and winking at his associates and muttering
to himself. Paul had taken no notice, but Marguerite
had stopped eating and sat in terror watching him over
Paul’s shoulder like a bird fascinated by a snake.
Tetarnis drew nearer and nearer with each turn, Marguerite
sat twisting her hands and imploring Paul to
go away and leave her. She was speaking in English
and in a whisper so that Henriette could not repeat the
words. But it was easy enough to translate them. “It
is for my sake,” she was saying. “It is for my sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Paul would not listen; and with a little helpless
flutter of her frail hands Marguerite sank back in
her chair. There would be a disturbance, very possibly
a fight. Once more she was to be the Helen of a
squalid Iliad and the result would be what it always
had been. She would move on—and this time there
was no whither she could move. She had come to the
end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could read the despair in her eyes, in the utter
abandonment of her body,” said Henriette, but there
had been much at that moment in Marguerite Lambert’s
thoughts which Henriette could not read at all.
The passionate dream of her life was dying, as she sat
there. She had come to the end. It would have no
chance of fulfilment now. Where to-morrow, could
she find the great love waiting for her? It had made
her life possible, it had given her strength to endure
the squalor of her lodging and her companions, and
the loss of all that daintiness and order which mean so
much to women. It had given her wit to defend herself
against the approaches of her courtiers, and the
self-respect which kept her with the manners of one
of gentlest birth. Nearer and nearer drew Petras
Tetarnis until he bumped against Paul’s chair, and then
very quickly and quietly Paul rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stifled prayer burst from Marguerite’s trembling
lips. Then she covered her face with her hands and
closed her ears with her thumbs. But there was no
disturbance at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Captain Paul took Petras by the elbow and
looking down upon him talked to him as one talks to
a child. I could hear what he said. ‘You are terrifying
this lady. You must not behave like this in public
places. You must go back to your place and sit very
quietly or you must go home.’ And Petras went.
Yes, without a word, as if he had been whipped he
went back to his chair amongst his friends. But, I
tell you, Monsieur, his eyes had all hell in them! And
after a little, very cautiously, as if he was afraid lest
the Captain Paul should notice him he crept to the
counter and talked very earnestly with Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was he saying?” asked Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not hear at all. I dared not even try to
listen. I went to the table where Marguerite and her
friend were sitting. Marguerite was imploring him
to go away. I agreed with her. The storm was over.
It was better for Marguerite’s sake that he should go
away quietly now without any fuss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he went?” asked Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at first,” returned Henrietta. “No, he was
stubborn. He was thinking of his pride, as men do,
not of the poor women who suffer by it. But at last—it
seemed that some idea came into his head, some
thought which made him smile—he consented. He paid
his bill and walked, neither quickly nor slowly through
the Bar and out by the passage into the street. And
so the people settled down, and the trouble seemed at
an end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so until the closing of the Bar it was. As a
rule the visitors had all gone by two o’clock in the
morning; and this particular night was no exception.
It was the practice as soon as the room was empty for
Madame Delagrange to pay the girls their seven francs
apiece at the counter. Then they crossed into the little
dressing room, changed their clothes and went out
into the lane by the street door, which was locked behind
them. On this night, however, Madame Delagrange
kept Marguerite Lambert to the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You others can run away and get off your clothes.
I want to have a little talk by myself with this delicate
Miss Touch-me-not,” she said, lolling over the counter
with a wicked leer on her coarse red face and licking
her lips over her victim. The others were very glad
to hurry away and leave the old harridan and Marguerite
alone in the gaudily tiled, brightly lit room. They
kept the door of the dressing room ajar, so that they
could both see and hear what took place. But for a
minute or two Madame Delagrange contented herself
with chuckling and rubbing her fat hands together and
looking Marguerite up and down from head to foot
and almost frightening the girl out of her wits. Marguerite
stood in front of the counter looking in her
short dancing skirt like a schoolgirl awaiting punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So this is how we repay kindnesses!” Madame Delagrange
began, slowly wetting her lips with her tongue.
According to Henriette she was exactly like an ogress
in a picture book savouring in anticipation the pretty
morsel she meant to devour for supper. “We make
troubles and inconveniences for the kind old fool of
a woman who lets us sing our little songs in her Bar
and dance with her clients and who pays us generously
into the bargain. We won’t help her at all to keep the
roof over her head. We treat her rich clients like mud.
Only the beautiful officers are good enough for us!
Bah! And we are virtuous too! Oh, he, he, he! Yes,
but virtue isn’t bread and butter, my little one. So
here’s an address.” She took a slip of paper from the
shelf behind her and pushed it towards Marguerite.
Marguerite took a step forward to the counter and
picked up the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do with this, Madame?” she asked
in perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are to go to that address, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, little fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is waiting for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shrank back, her face white as paper,
her great eyes wide with horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?” she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Petras Tetarnis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Delagrange nodded her head at Marguerite
with an indignant satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off you go! We shall be a little more modest, to-morrow
evening, eh? We shan’t look at everybody
as if they would dirty our little slippers if we stepped
on them. Come, take your seven francs and hurry
off. Or,” and she thrust out her lips savagely, “never
come back to the Villa Iris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite stood and stared at the paper in her
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t mean it, Madame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame snorted contemptuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make your choice, little one. I want to go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite folded the paper and with the tears running
down her cheeks slowly tore it across and across
and let the fragments flutter down to the floor. Madame
Delagrange uttered an oath and then let loose
upon the girl such a flood of vile abuse, that even those
hiding behind the door of the dressing room had never
heard the like of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with you,” she said, spitting upon the ground
and sweeping the seven francs off the counter towards
Marguerite, so that they rolled and spun and rattled
upon the floor. “Pick up your money and get your
rags together and march! Quick now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lolled over the counter screaming with laughter
as Marguerite ran hither and thither seeking through
her blinding tears for the coins, stooping and picking
them up. “There’s another somewhere,” the old harridan
cried, holding her fat sides. “Seek! Seek!
Good dog! It takes ten years off my life to see the
haughty Miss Touch-me-not running about after her
pennies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had got to retrieve them all. In the
dreadful penury in which she lived, a single franc had
the importance of gold. So she ran about the room,
searched under tables and chairs and in the corners.
The seven francs were all her capital. They stood between
her and death by hunger. She must go on her
knees and peer through the veil of her tears for the last
of them. Even the women behind the door, hardened
though they were, felt the humiliation of that scene in
the marrow of their bones, felt it as something horrible
and poignant and disturbing. As soon as Marguerite
had picked up her money, Madame Delagrange shuffled
out from behind her counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now come along with me. I mean to see that you
don’t take away what doesn’t belong to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the weeping girl by the elbow and pushed
her along in front of her to the dressing room. Then
she stood over her whilst she changed into her street
dress and put up her dancing kit in a bundle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you miss anything, girls?” Madame Delagrange
asked with her heavy-handed irony and indeed with
an evident hope that one of them would miss something
and the police could be sent for. But all of
them were quick to say no, though not one of them had
the courage to take Marguerite by the hand and wish
her good luck in the face of the old blowsy termagant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well then!” and Madame Delagrange took a
step towards Marguerite who shrank back as if she
expected a blow. Madame Delagrange laughed heartily
at the girl’s face, rejoicing to see her so cowed and
broken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here,” she said with a grim sort of pleasantry
and she grinned and beckoned with her finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite faltered across the room, and the big
woman took her prisoner again and marched her out
through the Bar onto the verandah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There! You can go out by the garden and a good
riddance to you!” Madame Delagrange banged to
the big doors behind Marguerite Lambert and bolted
them, leaving her with her bundle in her hand standing
on the boards beneath the roof of vines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the last we saw of her. Poor kid!” said
Henriette. “If she hadn’t been such a little fool! Do
you know that for a moment or two I hoped that your
friend—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul,” Gerard de Montignac interrupted with a nod
of his head. “I also—for a moment or two. But
women don’t mean much to Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette laughed bitterly, wondering to what man
women did mean anything at all. In her experience
she had never run across them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid for that little one,” she said, her
thoughts coming back to Marguerite. “You know
what happened? Her little bundle was found on the
balcony this morning. The knot had broken, and her
dancing dress, her slippers, her silk stockings were lying
scattered on the boards. She just left them where
they fell. You see, they were her stock-in-trade. She
had brought them over with her from France and she
has no money to replace them with. I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was conscious of a chill of
fear too. He recognised the significance of the abandonment
of that bundle. The knot had burst, as Marguerite
stood on the verandah, the doors shut behind
her, the dark garden in front of her. She had not
thought it worth while to gather her poor trifles of
finery together again. Their use was over. Whither
had she gone? Was she alive now? Had those roaring
breakers on the coast drawn her into their embrace
and beaten her to death upon the rocks and the sands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where does she lodge?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” answered Henriette. “None of us
know. She would never tell. I think that she had
some poor little room of which she was ashamed. With
her seven francs a day, she could have nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must find out,” cried Gerard, and then he struck
his fist upon the table. “But I can’t find out. I march
at six o’clock to-morrow morning for Fez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your friend then,” Henriette suggested eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul!” replied Gerard. “Yes. He has a few days
still in Casablanca. He has compassion, he will help.
I know him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henriette’s face lightened a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he must be quick, very quick,” she urged. “You
will see him to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go to him now,” and Gerard remembered
the letter in his pocket from Colonel Vanderfelt. “I
was indeed on my way to him when I came here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard looked at his watch. It was half past ten.
He had stayed longer than he had intended at the Villa
Iris.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch10'>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<h3>Colonel Vanderfelt’s Letter</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>G</span>erard</span> de Montignac found Paul still
up and putting the last words to the report of
long and solitary wanderings amongst the inland
tribes. The report was to be despatched the next
morning to the Bureau des Affaires Indigènes at Rabat,
and Gerard waited in patience until the packet was
sealed up. Then he burst out with his story of what
had taken place on the night before at the Villa Iris.
Paul listened without an interruption, but his face grew
white with anger and his eyes burned, as he heard of
Madame Delagrange’s coarse abuse and Marguerite’s
tears and humiliations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you see, Paul, it was your fault in a way,”
Gerard urged. “Of course sooner or later Petras
Tetarnis—damn his soul!—would have presented his
ultimatum, as he did last night, but you were the occasion
of it being done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Paul agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must find her. You must do what you
can, send her home, give her a chance. I’ll start searching
myself this very night. But you have more time
and better means of discovering her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul had knocked about Casablanca as a boy. He
had many friends amongst the natives, and was accustomed
to sit with them by the hour, drinking mint
tea and exchanging jokes. He was a man of property
besides in that town and could put out a great many
feelers in different quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no doubt that I can discover where she is,”
he said, “if she is still in Casablanca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where else can she be unless it’s in the sea!” cried
Gerard. “But remember you have got to be quick.
She had only the seven francs. God knows what has
become of her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood gazing at the lamp as if he could read her
whereabouts in that white flame as the gifted might do
in a crystal; with his cap tilted on the back of his head
and a look of grave trouble upon his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll find her, never fear,” said Paul Ravenel, touching
his friend upon the arm. “And what I can do to
keep her from harm that I will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard responded to the friendliness and the assurance
in Paul’s voice. He shook off his dejection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, mon vieux,” he said and held out his
hand. “Well, we shall meet in Fez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had reached the door before he remembered the
primary reason for his visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the way, I have a letter about you from some
one in England, a Colonel Vanderfelt. Yes, he is anxious
for news of you. He wrote to me because in
your letters to him you had more than once spoken of
me as your friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow darkened Paul’s face as he listened, and
a look of pain came into his eyes. He took the letter
from Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you answered it, Gerard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It only reached me to-night. I must leave
that to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door-keeper let Gerard out and he tramped
through the now silent and empty streets the length
of the town to the Market Gate; and so to his quarters
in the camp at Ain-Bourdja. Some years were to pass
before the two friends met again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul stood for a long time just as Gerard had left
him with Colonel Vanderfelt’s letter in his hand. The
fragrance of an English garden seemed to him to
sweeten this Moorish room. Though the lattices were
wide open, he heard no longer the thunder of the great
breakers upon the shore. The letter was magical and
carried him back on this hot night of May to a country
of cool stars. The garden, he remembered, would be
white with lilac, the tulips would be in flower, the rhododendrons
masses of red and mauve, against the house
the wisteria would be hanging in purple clusters. And
in the drawing room some very kindly people might at
this moment be counting the date on which they could
expect an answer to this letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, the answer would never come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All those pleasant dreams are over,” thought Paul.
“They have not heard from me for more than a year.
Let the break be complete!” and with a rather wistful
smile he tore the letter into shreds. Then he went out
and turning into a street by the sea-wall came to that
house from which Gerard de Montignac had seen him
and his agent depart three days before. A lattice was
open on the first floor and from a wide window a
golden flood of light poured out upon the night. Paul
whistled gently and then waited at the door. It was
thrown open in a few seconds, just time enough for
some one to run down the stairs and open it. Paul
stepped into a dark passage and a pair of slender arms
closed about his neck and drew his face down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, why didn’t you tell me how that
venomous old harridan treated you?” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite Lambert laughed with a note of utter
happiness which no one had heard from her for a long
while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, what did it matter any longer;” and
clinging to him passionately, she pressed her lips to
his.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul could have added a postscript to Henriette’s
story, as Gerard de Montignac had told it to him, if he
had so willed. For when Marguerite Lambert stood
alone on that verandah, her bundle in her hand, a figure
had risen up out of the darkness of the garden and
stepped onto the boards. She recoiled at the first moment
in terror, and her bundle slipped from her hand
and scattered its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite,” the man whispered, and with a wild
throb of her heart she knew it was Paul Ravenel who
was speaking to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You! You!” she said in so low a voice that, though
he stood at her side, the words only reached his ears
like a sigh. “Oh!” and her arms were about his shoulders,
her hands tightly clasped behind his head, and
her tear-stained cheeks pressed close against the breast
of his tunic. He tried to lift her face, but she would
not let him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! No!” she whispered. He could feel her
bosom rising and falling, and hear the sobs bursting
from her throat. Then she flung up her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear! My dear! I was hoping that some sudden
thing would kill me, because I couldn’t do it myself.
And then—you are here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew herself from his arms, and not knowing
what she did she kneeled and began to gather together
her scattered belongings. Paul Ravenel laughed and
stooping, lifted her up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t want those things any more, my dear,”
and with his arm about her he led her from the garden
through the quiet streets to this house by the sea-wall
which had been got ready against her coming.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch11'>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<h3>A Dilemma</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t</span> was the sixteenth day of April in the following
year. The dawn broke over Fez sullen and unfriendly
as the mood of the city. And all through
the morning the clouds grew heavier. Many watched
them with anxiety through that forenoon: the French
Mission which was to set out on the morrow, on its
return to Rabat with the treaty of the Protectorate of
Morocco signed and sealed in its pocket; Mulai Hafid
himself, now for these many months Sultan, who was
to travel with the Mission, on his way to Paris; various
high dignitaries of state, who though outwardly
wreathed in smiles and goodwill had prepared a little
surprise for the Mission in one of the passes on its
line of march to the coast; and various young officers
of the escort who after ten months of garrison duty
outside Fez welcomed a chance of kicking up their
heels for a week or two in the cafés of the coast towns.
Like conversation before dinner, all these arrangements
depended on the weather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At twelve o’clock Mulai Hafid gave a farewell luncheon
to the Mission in his great Palace in Fez Djedid;
and after luncheon he conducted his guests to a Pavilion
looking upon a wide open space called Mechouar.
They had hardly reached the Pavilion before a storm
burst with all the violence of the tropics. The Pavilion
was like everything else in Morocco. It had never
been finished when it was new, and never repaired
when it was old; and very soon, the rain breaking
through the flimsy roof had driven the guests from
the first floor to the chamber of audience below, and
was splashing down the stairs in a cascade. A general
discomfort prevailed. Mulai Hafid himself was in a
difficult mood. To one French Commissioner of importance
who apologized to him because a certain General,
lately promoted from Colonel, had not yet had
time to procure the insignia of his new rank, Mulai
Hafid replied dryly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sooner he gets them the better. He’ll want
them all to protect him before he has done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a little later when the Head of the Mission,
with whom he was playing chess, indiscreetly objected
to the Sultan moving surreptitiously one of his knights
with a latitude not authorised by the rules, he turned
in vexation to a Kaid of his friends and said: “See
what I have come to! I can no longer even move my
own cavalry as I please, without the consent of his
Excellency and the French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Altogether it was an uneasy luncheon party. Alone
Paul Ravenel was content. He was on duty with the
Mission and all the morning his face had been as
cloudy as the sky because the storm did not break.
Now he stood at a window of the upper room, sheltering
himself as best he might from the leaks of the
roof and smiled contentedly. Lieutenant Praslin, who
a year before had trumpeted the praises of Marguerite
Lambert in the mess at Ain-Bourdja, stood at his elbow.
Praslin commanded now a platoon in Paul’s company
and held his chief in awe. But annoyance spurred
him to familiarity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are amused, my old one, are you?” he enquired.
“We are of the escort to-morrow. We shall
swim through mud. The banks of the rivers will be as
slippery as a skating rink. We shall have horses and
camels tumbling about and breaking our necks. We
shall have ladies in the party too. And you are
amused! Name of a name, you have a sense of humour,
my Captain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I laugh,” replied Paul, “because if the rain continues,
we shan’t go at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you don’t want to go! To arrive safely at
Rabat with the Mission, it might easily mean your
step.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Paul should despise the indifferent gaieties of
Rabat and Casablanca—that was understood. He was
the serious one, destined for the high commands. But
here was opportunity and Paul Ravenel had been quick
to seize upon opportunity. There had been a pretty
little fight between Kenitra and Segota when Paul
was in command of the Advance Guard of Colonel
Gouraud’s convoy; and Paul had fought his little battle
with a resourceful skill which had brought his name
into the orders of the day. He had been for ten
months now in command of his Company at the great
camp of Dar-Debibagh, four kilometres out of Fez.
These were days of rapid promotion in an army where
as a rule promotion was slow. A successful march to
Rabat might well make him Commandant and give
him his battalion. Yet the look upon his face, as he
watched the sheets of rain turning the plain of the
Mechouar into a marsh, was the look of a man—no,
not relieved, but reprieved—yes, actually reprieved,
thought the Lieutenant Praslin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below them in the chamber of audience the Chiefs
of the Mission were at this moment debating the postponement
of the journey and they came quickly to the
only possible decision. The departure was put off for
three days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall go then, however,” said Praslin, when this
decision was announced. “The escort is made up.
There will be no change.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” Paul Ravenel replied. “In three days
a man may learn wisdom. The Mission may after all
wait until a sufficient force is assembled to protect it
properly and then the whole personnel of the escort
may be changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, those stories!” cried Praslin contemptuously.
He had the official mind which looks upon distrust of
official utterances as something next to sacrilege. And
official utterances had been busy of late. There was
no truth, they declared stoutly, in those stories that the
Maghzen, the Government itself, was stirring up disaffection
and revolt behind the back of the Mission.
Very likely the people of Fez were saying that the
Sultan was the prisoner of the French, that he was
being taken to Rabat and Paris to be exhibited triumphantly
as a captive; but the people of Fez were
born gossips and there was no danger in their talk.
Had not the Grand Vizier himself pledged his word
that the country was quiet? Thus the official mind.
Thus too, consequently, Lieutenant Praslin, who was
very anxious to see life as it is lived in the coast towns.
And if the Intelligence Division and some soldiers who
had spent years in the country took a different view,
why, soldiers were always alarmists and foolish people
and it was waste of time to listen to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul rode back through the rain with Lieutenant
Praslin to the camp at Dar-Debibagh when the reception
was over. They went by the Bab Segma and the
bridge over the Fez River. The track was already a
batter of mud above the fetlocks of their horses. At
seven o’clock, however, the rain ceased and Paul,
changing into a dry uniform, went into Praslin’s tent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am dining with a friend of mine in Fez,” he said,
“and I shall not be back until late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The battalion parade’s at six in the morning,”
Praslin reminded him. “The order has not been
countermanded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” answered Paul. “I shall be on duty of
course”; and mounting his horse he rode again into the
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode back by the way he had come and just
within the Bab Segma he met four Moors mounted
upon mules richly caparisoned, and themselves wearing
robes of a spotless white. They were clearly men
of high rank and one rode a little in advance of the
others. As Paul drew closer to them he recognised
this man as the Minister of War and one of the most
important dignitaries of the Maghzen. Paul saluted
him and to his amazement the Minister did not return
the salute but turned to one of his companions with a
dishonouring word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Djiffa!” he said contemptuously, and spat on the
ground. Paul took no notice of the insult. But if he
had needed proof of the stories which the official mind
refused to entertain, here it was openly avowed. Very
likely the postponement of the Mission’s departure
had upset the precious plans of the Maghzen and the
Minister of War was showing his displeasure. The
point of importance to Paul was that he should dare
to show it so openly. That could but imply very complete
plans for an ambuscade in force on the road of
the Mission to the coast, and a very complete confidence
as to the outcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul began to think of his own affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose that the Mission and its escort is destroyed,”
he reflected. “I have left nothing to chance.
No! The blow must fall as lightly as I can make possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He enumerated one by one the arrangements which
he had made and recalled the wording of his instructions
to his solicitors and agents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can think of nothing else,” he concluded.
He had this final request for help to make to-night, and
he was very sure that he would not make it in vain.
“No,—whatever money can do to lighten the blow—that
has been done. And money can do much assuredly.
Only—only”—and he admitted to himself
at last with a little shiver, a dark thought which he had
hitherto driven off—“she is just the kind of girl who
might commit suttee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode along the main street into the quarter of
Tala. It was a street always narrow, but sometimes
so narrow that if two mules met they could hardly
pass. High walls of houses without any windows
made it a chasm rather than a street. At rare intervals
it widened into a “place” or square, where a
drinking fountain stood or a bridge crossed a stream.
It was paved with broken cobble stones with a great
rut in the middle where the feet of the mules and
horses had broken down to the brown earth beneath;
and here and there a slippery mill-stone on which the
horse skidded, had been let in to the cobbles by way
of repair. It climbed steeply and steeply fell, and in
places the line of houses was broken by a high garden
wall above which showed orange trees laden with their
fruit and bougainvillæa climbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At times he passed under an archway where the
street was built over above his head and huge solid
doors stood back against the walls on either hand, that
one quarter might be shut off from another during the
night, or in times of trouble. On his right hand a
number of alleys led into the Souk-ben-Safi and the
maze of Fez-el-Bali. Into one of these alleys Paul
turned and stopped in front of a big house with an
imposing door studded with nails, and a stone by which
to mount a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dismounted and knocked upon the door. To
his surprise, it was not at once thrown open. He
looked about him. There was no servant waiting to
take his horse in charge. If there had been a mistake!
Paul’s heart sank at the thought. Suppose that his
friend Si El Hadj Arrifa, on whom so much now might
depend, had been called away from his home? But
that couldn’t be—surely! However peremptory the
summons had been, so punctilious a personage as Si
El Hadj Arrifa would have found a moment wherein
to put off his expected guest. Yet if nevertheless it
were so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel felt the weighty letter under his tunic
and gazed at the blank wall of the great house with
troubled eyes. Oh, he must talk with his friend to-night!
In three days the Mission and its escort were
to start. He might not get another chance. He redoubled
his blows upon the door and at last he heard
a key turn in the lock and a clatter as the wooden
cross-bars were removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That sound completed his uneasiness. He had ridden
through the city thinking of his own affairs, his
eyes in blinkers. Now tracing his steps in memory,
he recalled that the streets had been strangely quiet,
strangely empty. And here at the end of his journey
was this hospitable house barricaded against an invited
guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” he said, seeking to reassure himself, “the
danger’s out there in the ‘bled,’ on the way to the
coast, not here in the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a picture rose before his mind of four notable
Moors in milk-white robes mounted on mules with
trappings of scarlet and silver who sneered openly at
the uniform and spat. Paul Ravenel was frightened
now. If it was not only in the “bled” that danger
threatened, then all his careful letters and arrangements
were worth just as much as the cobble stones
underneath his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was open at last and as a servant took
Paul’s horse by the bridle and led it away to a stable,
Paul hurried impatiently into the house. But he was
no more impatient than the servant who closed and
bolted the door behind him; and in the passage he saw
a small troop of attendants, every one of them armed
and at the entrance from the passage into the central
court Si El Hadj Arrifa himself with a face of fear
and in the attitude of a man poised for flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when he caught sight of the gold lace upon
Paul’s uniform, the Moor’s expression changed to surprise
and surprise in its turn to a smile of welcome. Si
El Hadj Arrifa was a stout man, fair like so many of
the Fasi, with a fringe of beard round his fat face. He
was dressed in a silken shirt with an overgarment of
pink tissue under his white djellaba and his hands were
as well-kept as a woman’s. He wore a fine white haik
over his turban and fez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that you didn’t expect me,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Excellency is always welcome,” replied Si
El Hadj Arrifa. “Our poor little meal is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was not ready and Paul’s uneasiness increased.
He knew, however, that he would hear nothing until
hospitality was satisfied of its ceremonies and then
only by a roundabout road. He was led into a room
opening by means of a wide archway onto the court.
In one corner of the room stood a big modern brass
bedstead. It was an ornament and a decoration, nothing
more. For sleep, cushions upon the tiled floor
were used. Round the wall there were a great number
of clocks, Grandfather clocks, heavy Victorian clocks
of ormolu, clocks of marble, most of them ticking away
but registering quite different hours, and on the tiled
floor stood two branched candlesticks of shining silver
with the candles burning. Thick cushions were
stretched upon the tiles about the candles and upon
them Paul and his host took their seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa was a personage in Fez, a man of
influence in politics and of great wealth. He had visited
Manchester more than once, to buy cotton goods
and he talked of that town whilst they waited for
dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have good dentists,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul looked at this soigné and dainty gentleman in
the fine setting of his beautiful house, and smiled to
think of the figure he must cut in Manchester. He
probably wore a black gown like a gabardine and
elastic sided boots over white woollen socks and lived
in a small room in a dingy street. But Si El Hadj
Arrifa fell soon into an uneasy silence and sat listening
with his head cocked as if he expected some sound
from the city without to ring out over the open square
in the roof above the court. A fountain was playing
in the centre of the court in honour of the visitor, but
the Moor called to a servant to turn it off, since the
splash and tingle of the water so filled the ears that
they could apprehend nothing else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dinner was brought in at last by a couple of
negresses and Paul must eat of each course beginning
with sweetmeats, and ranging through a couscouss, a
roasted leg of mutton and a stuffed chicken. Paul put
his right hand into the dish and tore at the meat in
the due fashion and accepted tit-bits from the fingers
of his host. Some orange water was brought for him
to drink, and when the long meal was over one of the
negresses brought them a ewer and soap and poured
water over their hands whilst they washed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they have good dentists in Manchester,” said
Si El Hadj Arrifa and, taking a complete set of shining
teeth from his mouth, he washed them and polished
them and replaced them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They seem to have very good dentists there,” said
Paul with befitting gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silver tea kettle was brought and a silver spirit
lamp, and Si El Hadj Arrifa brewed two little cups of
heavily sweetened green tea and flavoured it with mint.
But even while engaged upon this important work, he
still kept his head cocked a little on one side, as though
he still listened for some dreaded yet expected sound.
And when he handed the cup to Paul, it rattled in the
saucer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing on this evening had so startled Paul
Ravenel. His heart jumped within his breast. Si El
Hadj Arrifa was not merely disturbed. His hand was
shaking. He was desperately afraid. He drew a
breath and leaned forward to speak and Ravenel said
to himself with relief. “At last! It is coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he was wrong. His host only enquired whether
Paul had ever visited America.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man in Manchester told me that they had a way
there of stuffing turkeys which was very good. But
they used oysters for it and of course so far from the
sea we can get none at Fez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some day there will be a railway,” said Paul consolingly.
Si El Hadj Arrifa made another brew of
tea, this time suspending in the brew a little lump of
ambergris to flavour it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must begin,” thought Paul, as he took his cup.
He felt for the big letter in his tunic but before he
could take it from his breast his host spoke in a low,
quiet tone, words which at first seemed of little more
importance than any which had been spoken before,
and afterwards were able to set Paul’s heart fluttering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent a messenger this evening to you at the camp
at Dar-Debibagh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He missed me,” replied Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sent him to warn you not to come into Fez to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are my friend. There is danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But outside the city,” cried Paul, “from the tribes—after
we have marched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here in Fez too,” Si El Hadj Arrifa insisted in a
voice which now frankly shook with terror. “For you
and all of your creed that dwell in this city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul was already on his feet, his face and his eyes
set in a stare of horror. Si El Hadj Arrifa quite misunderstood
the French officer’s manner. He said
soothingly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall stay in my house till it is all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All over?” Paul repeated. He took his hand from
the bulky letter in his tunic. If the dreadful news
were true, his plans must change. His heart sank as
he caught a glimpse of how they must change.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must know more, my friend,” he said, and he sat
quietly down again upon the cushions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are the Askris,” said the man of Fez, “the
tribesmen. You have taken them too quickly into your
armies. You have armed them too quickly. You
have placed them with their instructors in the Kashab
des Cherarda by the Segma gate as a garrison for this
town. Oh, madness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Paul agreed. “We should have waited a
year—two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are told that they must carry knapsacks,”
continued Si El Hadj Arrifa. “With us that is work
for women, an insult to men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t true,” said Paul Ravenel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does that matter if it is believed? The knapsacks
were carried on mules publicly through the city,
so that all men might see them. Six thousand of
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not by our orders,” said Paul, and the swift look
and the shrug of the shoulders with which the protest
was received told him much. It was by the order of the
Maghzen that those knapsacks had been paraded. The
Government itself was behind this movement in the
city as it was behind the insurrection on the plains.
Once more he saw very clearly the four contemptuous
notables upon their mules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we have known of this trouble,” said
Paul slowly. “But we thought that each instructor
could make it clear to his men that the story was a
lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa flung up his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the great lessons and nothing is learnt! Was
there not trouble once for the English in India? Was
there not talk of cartridges greased with the fat of
pigs? It was not true. No! But it served. As the
knapsacks will serve in Fez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little time,” cried Paul Ravenel, clutching at the
straw of that faint hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no time,” answered Si El Hadj Arrifa.
“Listen!” He looked swiftly behind him into the
shadows of the court to make sure that there were none
to overhear. “The revolt in Fez was planned for to-morrow,
after the Mission had departed. There was
to be a scouring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Askris are ready: more than ready. It was
difficult to hold them in, even with the promise of to-morrow.
Now that the departure is postponed, they
will not wait. It needs a word perhaps, but the speaking
of that word cannot be delayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul nodded gloomily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And they won’t believe it,” he said in a dull quiet
voice, as he stared upon the ground. Believe it? Paul
Ravenel knew very well that were he to batter down
the door of the Embassy, they would not even allow
him to blurt his story out. Why should he come prattling
his soldier’s silliness at that unearthly hour? Let
him go back to his camp and await his well-deserved
reprimand in the morning! There are proper channels
by which presumptuous young officers must address
their importunities. It is the history of many disasters.
Politics and ambition and the play of parties must decide
what is going to happen, not prescience or knowledge.
Is a country notoriously <span class='it'>studiis asperrima belli</span>?
Let us never admit it, lest we range against us this or
that faction which is strong enough to bring us down.
It’s all a gamble. So let us plank our money and
everybody else’s and their lives into the bargain on to
our colour and chance it turning up. “All rising to
Great Place is by a winding stair.” So we must twist
and turn and see nothing beyond the next step by which
we mount. Authority in Fez had just been given the
cravat of Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour, because
the negotiations for the Protectorate had been
conducted so smoothly and had ended in so resounding
a success. It would never do for authority to listen
to any intrusive soldier who insisted that murder
and torture were knocking on the door. Had not the
Maghzen declared that the tribesmen in the “bled”
were only thinking of their husbandry? Did not the
Grand Vizier himself guarantee the goodwill and
peacefulness of Fez?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have stopped their ears and bandaged their
eyes,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will stay here to-night,” his friend urged.
“No one, I think, saw you come into my house, and
my servants are faithful. Yes, you will stay here and
be safe until this danger is overpast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I cannot do,” he said, and Si El Hadj Arrifa
hearing the tone he used, knew that there would be no
persuading him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go while you can, and ride quickly with your
pistol loose in its holster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even so Paul did not move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his head to listen. The night was still as a
tomb. A cry even from the most distant corner of the
city, it seemed to him, must carry to this open square
of darkness above them. He had time. “Yes, wait,”
he repeated, and he went apart into the shadowy patio.
Never had he been set to face so tragic a dilemma. He
knew Si El Hadj Arrifa too well to doubt him. Nor
indeed had he any real doubt as to the choice which he
himself would make. The choice was in truth made,
had been made from the moment he was sure that torture
and massacre threatened those who remained in
Fez as much as those who marched to Rabat. But he
stood in that shadowy court of marble and tiles, gazing
with a great sorrow upon many lovely cherished
things which he was now forever to forego, his own
hopes and ambitions, a little circle of good friends,
honour and good report, a career of active service and
study well-applied, and at the end of it all a name
cleansed of its stain, and—even now the picture rose
before his mind—a dreamlike high garden fragrant
with roses, from which one looked out over moonlit
country to the misty barrier of the Downs. It was
such a farewell as he had never thought to make and
when he turned back into the room his face was twisted
as with a physical pain and anguish lay deep in his
brooding eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the envelope from his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall trust you with more than my life,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Excellency has honoured me with his friendship.
I am his servant in all things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been for three nights writing this letter. I
had it in my mind to open it here and read it to you.
But the bad news you have given me points to another
way. It may be that there will be no need to use it.
I give it into your hands and I beg you to keep it
sealed as it is, until you are certain of my death. If I
am alive I shall find a means to let you know. If I
am dead, I pray you to do all that I have written here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa took the letter and bowed his
forehead upon it, as though it carried the very Sultan’s
seal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With God’s will, I will do as you direct.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took his friend by the hand, and looked him in
the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not rest quiet in my grave if my wishes
written there were not fulfilled—if misfortune struck
where there is no need that it should strike. A voice
would call to me, in sorrow and distress, and I should
hear it and stir in my grave though I was buried
metres deep in clay. It is a promise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa struck a bell and a man came out
to him from the servants’ quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All is quiet, Mohammed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up till this hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His Excellency’s horse then! You will go in front
of him with a lantern as far as the Bab Segma. His
Excellency returns to the camp at Dar-Debibagh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The servant’s eyes opened wide in fear. He looked
from his master to his master’s guest, as though both
of them had been smitten with madness. Then he went
out upon his business, and the two men in the court
heard the fall of the bars and the grinding of the lock
of the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will put this away,” said Si El Hadj Arrifa, balancing
the letter in his hands; and he went upstairs to
his own room. When he came down Paul was standing
in the patio, with his cap upon his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will bid you good-bye here my friend,” said Paul,
but his host, terrified though he was, would not so far
fall short of his duties. He went out with Paul Ravenel
to the street. The city all about them was very
quiet. There was no light anywhere but the light in
the big lantern which Mohammed was carrying in one
hand whilst he held the bridle of Paul’s horse with the
other. Paul mounted quickly and without a word.
Si El Hadj Arrifa stood in the doorway of his house.
He watched the lantern dwindle to a spark, he heard
the sharp loud crack of the horse’s shoes upon the
cobbles soften and grow dull. He waited until the
spark had vanished, and, a little time afterwards, the
beat of the hoofs had ceased. And still there was no
sign of any trouble, no distant clamour as of men
gathering, no shrill cries from the women on the roofs.
He went back into his house.</p>

<h3>The Little Door in the Angle</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>i El Hadj Arrifa</span> squatted upon his cushions
and stared at the flames of the candles in
his branched silver candlestick. Captain Paul
Ravenel would be half way through the Tala now. It
was always in that quarter of the town that turbulence
began. He would be half way through the Tala, therefore
half way between this house and the Bab Segma
too. And as yet there was not a cry. Si El Hadj
Arrifa had never known a night so still. But then he
had never listened before with such an intensity of
fear, fear for himself, fear for that friend of his riding
through the silent town, with the lantern swinging
close to the ground in front of him. The sky had
cleared after the rain and the stars were bright above
the open square of the roof. But it was dark and once
past the Bab Segma and clear of the town, Paul Ravenel
would slip like a swift shadow over the soft
ground to Dar-Debibagh. He must be near the gates
by now. Si El Hadj Arrifa pictured him now skirting
the gardens of Bou Djeloud and very close to the gate;
a few yards more, that was all. Si El Hadj Arrifa
imagined him knocking upon the gate for the watchman
to open it. A sense of relief stole over the Moor.
Mohammed would be back very soon now. Upon the
relief followed drowsiness. Si El Hadj Arrifa’s head
fell forward upon his breast and his body slipped into
an easier attitude.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Paul Ravenel was undoubtedly rapping upon
the Segma gate, but rapping rather urgently, rather insistently.
How those dogs of watchmen slept, to be
sure! And Si El Hadj Arrifa woke with a start and
very cold. It was upon his own outer door that some
one knocked urgently and insistently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Moor rose to his feet and stopped. His eyes
had fallen upon his fine silver candlesticks and he stood
upright and stiff in a paralysis of terror. The candles
had burnt low. He had slept there for a long time.
Mohammed should have been back an hour ago. The
sound of his knocking, too, urgent, yet with all its
urgency, discreet, spoke, like a voice of fear. Something
untoward then had happened. Yet the city
still slept. Si El Hadj Arrifa was no braver than most
of his fellow townsmen. He shivered suddenly and
violently and little whimpers of panic broke from his
lips. Massacres were not conducted quietly. Uproar
and clamour waited upon them; and the strange and
eerie silence brooding over the town daunted the soft
luxurious Moor till his bones seemed to melt within his
body. It was stealthy and sinister like an enemy hidden
in the dark. He crept into the passage and listened.
There was nothing to hear but the urgent scratching
and rapping upon the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that you, Mohammed?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa unfastened the door and held it
ajar, looking out. Mohammed was alone, and there
was no longer a lantern in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in! And make no noise!” said Si El Hadj
Arrifa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed slipped into the passage, closed the
strong door so cautiously that not a hinge whined,
then locked and bolted and barred it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now follow me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Moor led the way back to the room with the
brass bedstead and sank like a man tired out on to the
cushions. His servant stood in front of him with a
passive mask-like face and eyes which shone bright
with fear in the light of the candles. “Speak low!”
said Si El Hadj Arrifa; and this is the story which
Mohammed told in a voice hardly above a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French officer did not ride to the Segma Gate.
He called in a quiet voice to Mohammed and turned
off towards the Bab-el-Hadid on the south of the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Bab-el-Hadid,” Si El Hadj Arrifa repeated
in wonderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But his Excellency did not go as far as the gate.
He stopped at the hospital and dismounted,” said Mohammed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa’s face lightened. The hospital
was the headquarters of the military command. Paul
Ravenel had taken his story there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul had remained for a long time in the hospital.
Two officers came out with him at length, one of whom
was dressed in slippers and pyjamas with a dressing
gown thrown on as if he had been wakened from his
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was his Excellency smiling?” asked Si El Hadj
Arrifa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The other two were smiling. His Excellency
shrugged his shoulders and mounted his horse heavily
like a man in trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa nodded his head and muttered to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will not believe,” he said. “No, they will not
believe.” He looked towards Mohammed. “Then he
went out by the Bab-el-Hadid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Paul had not. He had turned his back to the
Bab-el-Hadid and bade Mohammed lead to the
Karouein quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went for a while through silent empty streets,
Mohammed ten paces or so ahead, holding the lantern
so that the light shone upon the ground and Paul
Ravenel following upon his horse. Mohammed did
not turn round at all to see that the Captain was following
him, but the shoes of the horse clacked on the
cobbles just behind him and echoed from wall to wall.
They came to the first gate and it was open. The great
doors stood back against the wall and the watchman
was not at his post. Mohammed was frightened. An
omission to shut off the quarters of the city one from
the other at night could not be due to negligence. This
was an order given by authority. However, no one
stopped them; they saw no one; they heard no one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to a second gate. This too stood wide.
Beyond the gate the street was built over for a long
way making a black tunnel, and half way down the
tunnel it turned sharply at a right angle. When this
corner had been turned, a glimmer of twilight far
ahead would show where the tunnel ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed passed in under the roof over the street
and after he had walked some twenty paces forward,
he judged that Captain Ravenel had fallen a little behind,
the shoes of the horse no longer rang so clearly
on the stones. He turned then, and saw horse and
rider outlined against the dark sky, as they reached the
tunnel’s mouth. He noticed Paul Ravenel bent forward
over the neck of his horse to prevent his head
from knocking against the low roof. Then he entered
the tunnel and was at once swallowed up in the blackness
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed walked forward again rather quickly.
For he was afraid of this uncanny place, and turned
the angle of the street without looking round again.
He did not think at all. If he had, he would have
understood that once the feeble flicker of his lantern
were lost beyond the corner, Paul Ravenel would be
left in the darkness of the blind, the mouth of the tunnel
behind him, a blank wall before his face. Mohammed
was in a fever to reach the open street again and
now that he saw it in front of him at the end of the
passage opaquely glimmering as an uncurtained window
on a dark night will glimmer to one in a room, he
pushed eagerly forward. He was close to the outlet
when he realised that no horse’s hoofs rang on the
cobbles behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and peered back into the tunnel. There
was nothing to be seen and there was no sound. Mohammed
did not dare to call out. He stood wavering
between his duty and his fear; and suddenly a tremendous
clatter broke the silence and frightened Mohammed
out of his wits. Mohammed had just time
to draw back close against the wall when a horse
dashed past him at a full gallop. A stirrup iron struck
and tore his djellaba and the horse was gone—out of
the tunnel up the street. But Mohammed’s eyes were
now accustomed to the darkness. He was able to see
against the sky that the horse was riderless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something had startled the horse and the French
Captain was thrown. He was lying on the ground
back there, in the darkness. That was all! Thus Mohammed
reasoned, listening. Yes, certainly that was
all—except that it might well be that the French Captain
was hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed must return and find out. Quaking with
alarm he retraced his steps, throwing the light of his
lantern on one side of the passage after the other. But
so far the passage was empty. No doubt the Captain
would be lying on the ground beyond the angle
where the tunnel turned. But here too he searched
in vain. The Captain had disappeared: somewhere
between the two outlets in this black place. He had
gone!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed lifted the lantern above his head, swinging
it this way and that so that the light flickered and
danced upon the walls. Then his arm grew steady.
Opposite it to him in the darkest corner there was a
little door studded with great nails—a door you never
perceived though you passed through the tunnel ten
times a day. Mohammed crossed to it, touched it,
shook it. It was locked and bolted. He was debating
whether he should knock upon it or no. But he dared
not. This was the beginning of that Holy War which
was to free El Magreb from the clutch of the Christians,—the
stealthy beginning. To-morrow there would
not be one of them alive in Fez, and outside Fez the
land would be one flame of vengeance. If the French
Captain were behind that little door he must be praying
for a swift death!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed drew back and suddenly the mouth of
the tunnel was obscured and he saw the figures of two
men. Panic had been hovering about Mohammed these
many minutes since. It took him by the throat and
the heart now. With a cry he dashed his lantern on
the ground and fled leaping, past the two men. He
was not followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the story which Mohammed told to Si El
Hadj Arrifa in the room with the clocks and the brass
bedstead and the silver candelabra.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the gate by Karouein Mosque?” said the
master, when his servant had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa nodded his head thoughtfully.
He did not believe that the Captain had been captured
or slain in this noiseless fashion. He himself had
been bidden not to open that big envelope locked away
upstairs until he was very certain that Paul Ravenel
was dead. The Captain had his plans into which it
was no business of his friend to pry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to that little door, Mohammed,” he said. “It
will be well to forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is forgotten, Master,” answered Mohammed, and
far away but very clear and musical in the silence of
the night the voice of a mueddin on a lofty minaret
called the Faithful to their prayers.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch13'>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<h3>The Companions of the Night</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>i El Hadj Arrifa</span> was right. When Mohammed
saw Paul Ravenel ride forward out of
the loom of the night into the darkness of the
tunnel, bending his head so that it might not strike the
roof, he missed a slight action which was much more
significant. Paul slipped his right hand into his pocket
and took out a heavy key. He had been seeing to it that
Mohammed should draw gradually ahead and by the
time when he came opposite to the little door in the
angle, Mohammed was far beyond the turn and there
was not the faintest glimmer of light from the lantern.
Paul slipped from his saddle, gave his horse a sharp
cut across the buttocks with his riding whip, and as the
startled animal galloped off, turned quickly to the little
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was in a darkness so complete that he could not
see the key in his hand nor the hand that held it. Yet
he found the keyhole at once and in another second
he was within the house. The passage in which he
found himself was as black as the tunnel outside. Yet
he locked the door, picked up and fitted the stout
transverse bars into their sockets as neatly as though
he worked in the broad noon. He had made no sound
at all. Yet he had shut a door between the world and
himself, and the effort of his life now must be to keep
it for ever closed. He had a queer fancy that a door
thus momentously closing upon his fortunes ought to
clang so loudly that the noise of it would reach across
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was once a Paul Ravenel,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lantern in Mohammed’s hands flickering upon
the walls of the tunnel and every second dwindling a
little more, receding a little more, danced before his
eyes. There went the soul and spirit of that Paul
Ravenel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was aroused from his misery by the sound of
Mohammed’s hands sliding curiously over the panels
of the door. The cry of panic followed quickly and
the clatter of the lantern upon the cobble stones. Paul
waited with his pistol in his hand, wondering what
had startled his attendant. But silence only ensued
and he turned away from the door into the house. At
the end of a short passage he opened a second door
and stood on the threshold of a small court brightly lit
and beautiful. A round pool from which a jet of
water sprang and cooled the sultry air was in the centre
of the white-tiled floor. Wooden pillars gaily painted
and gilded and ornamented in the Moorish fashion, not
by carving but by little squares and cubes and slips of
wood delicately glued on in an intricate pattern, supported
arches giving entrance to rooms. There was a
cool sound of river water running along an open conduit
waist-high against a wall; and poised in an archway
across the court with her eyes eagerly fixed upon
the passage stood Marguerite Lambert, a tender and
happy smile upon her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Paul Ravenel saw her, the remorse which had
been stinging him during the ride and had reached a
climax of pain as he stood behind the door, was stilled.
Marguerite had changed during this year. The hollows
of her shoulders and throat had filled. The haggard
look of apprehension had vanished from her face.
Colour had come into her cheeks and gaiety into her
eyes and a bright gloss upon her hair. She wore a
fragile little white frock embroidered with silver which
a girl might have worn at a dance in a ball room of
London or Paris; and in the exotic setting of that
court she seemed to him a flame of wonder and beauty.
And she was his. He held her in his arms, the softness
of her cheek against his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite!” he said. “Each time I see you it is
for the first time. How is that?” But Marguerite
did not answer to his laugh. She held him off and
scanned him with anxious eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something has happened, Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you came in, you were troubled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I saw you the trouble passed. I was afraid
that you might be angry. I am very late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite did not believe one word of that explanation,
but the way to discover the true one did not
lie through argument. She drew Paul across the court,
holding him by the hand and saying lightly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foolish one, should I quarrel with you on the
evening before you march away? You might never
come back to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led him into a side room and drew him down
beside her on the thick, low cushions. Upstairs there
were chairs and tables and the paraphernalia of a
western home. Here on the level of the patio and the
street they had for prudence’ sake kept it all of the
country. There was no brass bedstead, it is true, to
ornament the room, but there were three tall grandfather
clocks, though only one of them was going and
that marked the true time. Marguerite laid her head
in the hollow of his shoulder and her arm went round
his waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, you won’t get killed!” she whispered. “Oh,
take care! take care! I am afraid. This year has been
so perfect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must have been lonely many days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And many nights,” whispered Marguerite, with a
little grimace. Then she laughed with the trill of a
bird. “But you had just gone or you were soon returning
and my thoughts were full of you. I am not
difficult and thorny, am I, Paul? Say so! Say so at
once!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laid her down so that her shoulders rested on his
knee and her face smiled up at him, and bending he
kissed her on the mouth for an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are the most golden thing that ever happened
in this world,” he said. “I think of all those years
that I lived through, before I met you, quite contented
with myself and knowing nothing—no, absolutely nothing
of the great miracle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What miracle, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The miracle of man and woman,—of you and me—who
want to be together—who are hungry when we
are not together,—who walk amongst rainbows when
we are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul was the “grand serieux,” as Gerard de Montignac
had called him, warning him too of that very
fate which had befallen him. Love of this girl had
swept him off his feet, calf-love and man’s love had
come to him at once. Marguerite was new and entrancingly
strange to him as Eve to Adam. He made
much of her judgment, as lovers will, marvelling when
she swept to some swift, sane decision whilst he was
debating the this and the that. She entertained him
one moment as though he were an audience and she
a company of players; she was the tenderest of companions
the next: in her moments of passion she made
him equal with the gods; and the pride and glory to
both of them was that each had been the first to enter
the heart and know the embraces of the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, what are you thinking about?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the prettiest frock I have seen you in,” said
he, and with a smile of pleasure she raised herself and
sat at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the prettiest I have got,” she returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul lifted a strip of the fragile skirt between his
fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a funny thing, Marguerite,” he said. “But
until I knew you, I never noticed at all whether a girl
was wearing a topping frock or whether she was
dowdy. So long as they had something over their
shoulders, they were all pretty much the same to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now?” asked Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’s different,” said Paul, disappointing her
of her expected flattery. “That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite laughed, as she could afford to. As she
knew very well, he loved to see her straight and slim
in her fine clothes and it gave him an entrancing little
sensuous thrill to feel the delicate fabrics draping exquisitely
her firm young body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul, before he had set out with Colonel Gouraud’s
supply column on the expedition to Fez, had sent Marguerite
across the Straits and up to Madrid, where a
credit was opened for her at one of the banks. Paul
had been afraid lest she should stint herself, not only
of luxuries but of things needed. But she had answered,
“Of course I’ll take from you, my dear. I am
proud to take from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked back upon that journey now and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had six glorious weeks in Madrid. Fittings and
fittings and choosing colours, and buying shoes and
stockings and hats and all sorts of things. I began at
half past nine every morning and was never finished
till the shops closed. I had never had any money to
spend before. Oh, it was an orgy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you regret those weeks?” asked Paul, misled
by the enjoyment with which she remembered them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. I had more fun still when I came back
with what I had bought. I was going to make myself
beautiful in the eyes of my lord!” and mockingly she
pushed her elbow into his side, as she sat beside
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite, upon her return, had waited for some
weeks in Tangier. Paul had to make sure that he was
to be stationed at Fez. Afterwards he had to find and
buy this house, furnish it and provide a staff of servants
on whose fidelity he could rely. He had secured two
negresses and an Algerian, an old soldier who had
served with him in the Beni-Snassen campaign before
he had ever come on service to Morocco. Even when
all was ready at Fez there was a further delay, since
the road from Tangier to Fez was for a time unsafe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was tired of waiting, long before Selim and the
negress and the little escort you sent for me appeared,”
she said. “But the journey up country I
adored.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was early in the year. The ten villages with their
hedges of cactus; the rolling plains of turf over-scattered
with clumps of asphodel in flower; the aspect of
little white-walled towns tucked away high up in the
folds of hills; the bright strong sun by day, the
freshness of the nights, and the camp fires in that open
and spacious country were a miracle of freedom and
delight to this girl who had choked for so long in the
hot and tawdry bars of the coast towns. And every
step brought her nearer to her lover. It was the season
of flowers. Great fields of marigold smiled at her.
Yellow-striped purple iris nodded a welcome. Rosy
thrift, and pale-blue chicory, and little congregations of
crimson poppies, and acres of wild mustard drew her
on through a land of colour. And here and there on
a small knoll a solitary palm overshadowed a solitary
white-domed tomb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rode a mule and wore the dress of a Moorish
woman. All had been done secretly, even to the purchase
of the house in Fez, which was held in the name
of a Moorish friend of Paul’s. It was Marguerite’s
wish from first to last. Paul would have proclaimed
her from the roof tops, had she but lifted an eyebrow.
But she knew very well that it would not help Paul in
his career were he to bring a pretty mistress up from
the coast and parade her openly in Fez. He would
get a name for levity and indiscretion. Moreover, the
secrecy was for itself delightful to her. It was to her
like a new toy to a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love a secret,” she had said once to Paul, when he
urged that her life was dull. “It sets us a little further
apart from others and a little nearer together. It
will be fun keeping it up, and we shall laugh of an
evening, locked safely away in the midst of Fez in our
little hidden palace.” It was fun, too, for Marguerite
to dress herself in a fine silk caftan of pink or pale
blue reaching to her feet, to pass over the mansouriya,
to slip her bare feet into little purple embroidered
heelless slippers, to wind a bright scarf
about her hair, to burden her ankles and arms with
heavy clashing rings of silver, to blacken her long eyelashes
and veil the lower part of her face and go shopping
with one of the negresses in the Souk-Ben-Safi.
It was fun also to return home and transform herself
into a fashionable girl of the day and wait in this
southern patio for the coming of her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love routine like a dog,” she said on this evening.
She was sitting on the low cushion by Paul’s side.
Her slim legs showing pink through the fine white silk
of her stockings were stretched out in front of her.
She contemplated the tips of her small white satin
slippers. “I don’t want any more surprises,” and
Paul’s face grew for a moment grave and twitched
with a stab of pain. “I don’t want any more people.
I have had enough of both. I love going up on the
roof and watching that great upper city of women,
and wondering what’s going on in the narrow streets
at the bottom of the deep chasms between the houses.
I have books, too, and work when I’m not too lazy to
do it, and I am learning the little two-stringed guitar,
and I want one person, one foolish dear person, and
since I’ve got him, I’m very happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul reached forward and, closing a hand round one
of her ankles, shook it tenderly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me, Marguerite!” he began, but she was
upon her feet in an instant. She snatched up Paul’s
kêpi and cocked it jauntily on her curls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Canada?” she cried in a sharp, manly voice, and
saluted, bringing her high heels together with a click
and standing very stiff and upright. She hummed the
tune of “The Maple Leaf,” interpolating noises meant
to parody the instruments of an orchestra, and she
marched in front of Paul and round the patio quickly
and briskly like a girl in a pantomime procession, until
she came back to her starting point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Australia!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again she saluted and marched round to the tune of
“Australia will be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The U-nited States of America!” she announced,
and this time she skimmed round the patio in a sort
of two-step dance, swift as a bird, her white and
silver frock glinting and rippling as she moved.</p>

<p class='noindent'>she sang, and she returned to her starting point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great Britain!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here she saluted for a long time while marking time
and calling out in a gruff voice: “One, two, one, two!
Can’t you girls keep time! Miss Montmorenci, you’ve
a ladder in your stocking, and if you think any one is
going to take the trouble to climb up it, you flatter
yourself. Miss de Bourbon, you haven’t marked your
face and it can do with a lot!” and off she went to the
tune of the “British Grenadiers.” When she came opposite
to Paul again she held out her short skirt on
each side, dropped a low curtsey and declared:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that, ladies and gentlemen, will conclude our
entertainment for this evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was to conclude their entertainment for many and
many an evening, for whilst Paul laughed and applauded,
from right above their heads, it seemed, a
voice vibrant and loud and clear dropped its call to
prayer through the open roof of the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allah Akbar! God is above all. There is no God
but God and Mohammed is his prophet. Rise and
pray! Rise and do the thing that is good. There is
no God but God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the same voice to which Si El Hadj Arrifa
was listening in another quarter of the city. Paul’s
house was built in the very shadow of the Karouein
Mosque, and the voice pealing from its high minaret in
the silence of the night, familiar though both Marguerite
and he were with it, never failed to startle
them. It was a voice deep, resonant, a voice of music
and majesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Companions of the Sick!” said Paul, as they
listened to it without moving, caught in the spell of its
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are ten of them,” said Marguerite. “Like
all the rank and fashion of Fez, I set my clocks by
their voices.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ten,” Paul explained. “Ben Hayoun, a rich
man lay very ill in this city, and night after night he
could get no sleep. The silence became terrible to him.
He felt an appalling sense of loneliness as the hours
dragged by and not a sound varied them. So, when
he recovered, he founded this order of ten mueddins,
each of whom must chant the summons to prayer for
a half of one of the five hours which precede the dawn,
so that those in pain shall be no more alone. They
call them the companions of the sick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite looked up to the open roof and the stars
above it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I often wonder what they think when they look
down upon this bright square of light beneath them:
whether they speculate who live here and why they
stay up so late of nights. I fancy sometimes that the
mueddin is looking down and watching us as we move
about the court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood for a moment gazing upwards, and then
her mood changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One o’clock,” she cried, and running to the clock
against the wall, she opened the glass which protected
its face and adjusted the hands. “Paul, I’ll give you
a whiskey and soda, and you must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to him, trying to laugh gaily, but her
voice broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have to be on parade at six and you have miles
to go before you reach your camp.” Her gaiety deserted
her altogether. She flung herself into his arms
and clung to him, pressing her face against his coat.
“Oh, my dear, when shall I see you again? I wish
that you weren’t going. Yes, I do! Though I pretend
to laugh and to think nothing of it when I am
with you, I have been praying for a week with all my
heart that something might happen to keep you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something has happened,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite lifted her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, Paul!” she cried joyfully. But there was a
look on his face which dashed her joy. Marguerite
was quick in those days to fall from a high buoyancy
of spirit to forebodings and alarm. This miracle of
her happiness was balanced on so fine a needle point
that sometime it must drop and break into a thousand
useless shining splinters. “Why aren’t you going?”
she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of the rain.” Paul Ravenel explained.
“The departure of the Mission is postponed for three
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only for three days?” Marguerite repeated with a
wistful droop of the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t leave after three days,” said Paul. “It
won’t leave Fez for a long while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke very gravely and after a moment of silence
Marguerite disengaged herself gently from his
embrace. A trace of the haggard look which had once
been so familiar upon her face was visible there
again: so visible that Paul wondered whether some
hint of the threatened massacre had not been given to
her by Selim or the negresses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you were in great trouble when you came into
the court to-night, and when I asked you why, you put
me off with an excuse. The truth now, Paul, please!”
she pleaded though she caught her breath at the
thought of what the truth might mean to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have courage, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyelids closed and fluttered over her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall need it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sank down upon the cushions, for her knees had
given under her. Paul did not understand the real
cause of her distress until she took his hand between
both of hers and spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t hesitate, my dear. Of course I have
always lived in fear that our life together couldn’t go
on. In my happiest moments, deep down, I have felt
that dread. Perfection’s not allowed, is it? There’s
a jealousy that will shatter it. I was sure of that.
But I always hoped—not yet. I always prayed for a
little longer time to make up for the wretched years
before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If trouble was mentioned to Marguerite Lambert in
those days she had just the one interpretation of the
word. It meant separation from Paul and therefore
the ending of all things. Her passion occupied her,
heart and brain and blood. She had waited for it, curiously
certain that she would not be denied it. Now
that the great gift was hers, she was in a desperate
alarm lest she should wake one morning to discover
that it had been filched from her in the night. Paul
dropped down upon the cushions at her side and with
a tender laugh drew away her hands from her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, you are foolish. It isn’t separation,
of course. You haven’t to fear that—no, nor ever will
have to. Believe me, Marguerite! Look at me and
say you believe me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned her face towards him and held it between
his hands and her eyes lost their trouble and smiled at
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. Now listen, Marguerite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her a little shake. For since she knew that
the one evil which she dreaded was not to befall her she
had ceased to attend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am listening, Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dined with a friend of mine to-night. I went
there to leave him a letter of instructions about you if
anything happened to me on our march down to the
coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happened to you?” she exclaimed with a sharp intake
of her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expected an attack. Si El Hadj Arrifa would
have seen that you were sent safely down to the coast.
My agents there would have taken care of you. You
would of course never want for anything again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should want for everything,” said Marguerite
slowly. “I don’t think, Paul, that I could go on living.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was told of a girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when her husband died,
she dressed herself in her wedding gown—I couldn’t
do that, my dear,” she interpolated with a little whimsical
smile. “Then she lay down on her bed and took
poison.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I often think of that girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, you shouldn’t. It’s morbid. You are
young. Even if I went—” but there came a stubborn
look upon Marguerite Lambert’s face against which he
was well aware his finest arguments would beat in
vain. “I’ll discuss that with you when it’s necessary,”
he said. “To-night my friend Si El Hadj Arrifa
warned me that not only was the Mission to be attacked
on its way to the coast, but that there would also
be a rising here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had Marguerite’s attention now. She looked at
him with startled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Fez?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will mean—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let us face it. A massacre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shivered and caught Paul’s hand. She
looked about the court outside the lighted room in
which they sat. There were shadowy corners which
daunted her. She looked upwards, straining her ears.
But the ceaseless chant of the mueddin on the minaret
of the Karouein mosque alone broke the silence of the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When is it to be?” she whispered, as though the
fanatics were already gathered about her door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night, probably. To-morrow, certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you can trust your friend’s word?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I would trust yours,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite drew closer to her lover and huddled
against him. He put his arm about her. She was
trembling. The fun of the masquerade was over. She
wondered now how without fear she could have wandered
with her black servant through the narrow,
crowded markets and in those deep, maze-like streets;
she pictured to herself the men; furtive, sleek Fasi;
wild creatures from the hills with long muskets gleaming
with mother-of-pearl; brawny men of the people,
and she painted their faces with the colours and the fire
of fury and fanaticism. This little house shut in and
crowded about with a thousand houses! She had
thought of it as a secret palace hidden away in the
uncharted centre of a maze. Now it seemed to her a
trap set in a jungle of tigers—a trap in which she and
Paul were caught. And her thoughts suddenly took a
turn. No, only she was in that trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened, turning her face upwards to the open
roof. The city was still quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, there are other Christians scattered in houses
in the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t you give a warning? So that troops from
the camp might be hurried into the town? Leave your
uniform here! Dress in your djellaba and your Moorish
clothes. You can reach headquarters—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already been there. They will not believe,”
said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite thought for a little while, summoning
her strength to assist her, and the memory of the great
debt she owed her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she said. “You have done all that you
can. You must go back to the camp now, Paul, while
you still can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be all right, Paul. No one suspects this
house. You have always been careful when you came
here that the tunnel was empty. At the worst I have
the little Belgian automatic pistol you gave me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Paul repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your place is in the camp with your men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have leave,” said Paul. “I applied for leave the
moment I knew that we had three days more in Fez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite did not for a moment doubt the truth of
what he said. He spoke so simply. It was so natural
a thing that he should ask for leave. She gave up the
little scheme to which she had steeled her heart. Her
arms crept about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” she whispered with a sigh of relief. “I
have tried to send you away, haven’t I? I have done
my best and you won’t go! I am glad, Paul, I am
glad! Alone I should have shivered in terror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be together, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her lips trembled to a smile. Danger thus encountered
seemed in the anticipation hardly to be considered
a danger at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” she said, lifting her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice of another mueddin now rang out across
the city. Marguerite rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This lighted square just above our heads, Paul, is
just beneath his feet. Let us give him no cause to
wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put out the candles and returned to Paul
Ravenel’s side. They sat together in the darkness,
huddled against one another, whilst the companions of
the sick followed one another upon the high minaret
of the Karouein mosque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once, twice when some stray cries broke the silence
Paul whispered eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is beginning,” and as silence followed upon the
cries. “No! No!” he added in a dull voice, a voice of
disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, you wish it to begin!” said Marguerite in
wonder, and she tried to distinguish the expression of
his face, even though the darkness showed her nothing
but the silhouette of his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be the sooner over,” said Paul quickly.
“The revolt can’t last long in any case. There’s a
strong column in the field just south of Meknes. A
call from the wireless and four days will bring them
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was another reason why with all his soul
he prayed to hear the still night break up in a clatter
of firing and fierce cries. If the revolt began to-night,
why then he himself had been caught in it, had been
forced to seek a refuge, had been unable to regain his
post. Who could gainsay him? All was saved—Marguerite
and honour too. Whereas if the morning
came and Fez was still at peace and his appointed place
empty—then some other man must fill it. But the
voices on the minaret rang out in music above their
heads, until Marguerite said: “This is the last. It is
he who raises the flag over the mosque. In half an
hour we shall have the dawn.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<h3>The Tunic</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>“M</span>arguerite,</span> you must go to bed,” said
Paul. “I’ll rouse you if there’s any danger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very near to the dawn now. There was a
freshness and an expectation in the air; a faint colourless
light was invading the darkness; in the patch of
sky above their heads the bright stars were swooning.
For most of this last half hour Marguerite’s head had
lain heavy upon his shoulder, and if she opened her
eyes it was only to close them again with a sigh of content.
Paul lifted her on to her feet and led her up the
stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you, Paul?” she asked, drowsily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall be within call. I shall sleep for a little on
the cushions below. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite noticed that the voice of the last mueddin
ceased whilst she was still preparing herself for her
bed; and after she had got into it, she heard a kettle
singing cheerfully in the court below as if Paul were
brewing for himself some tea. Then, with the doors
of her bedroom open upon the little gallery above the
court she went fast asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hours afterwards a shattering noise awakened her.
She lay for a few moments deliciously poised between
sleep and consciousness, and vaguely thinking her long
and troubled vigil to have been a nightmare which the
light of day had happily dispelled. The sunlight was
falling in a sheet of gold through the open roof. “It
must be very late,” she reflected, lazily, and thereupon
sharply and crisply two shots from a rifle split the air.
Marguerite sprang up in her bed with a hand to her
heart, as though one of those shots had wounded her.
It was just the same noise which had broken through
her slumbers. The nightmare was true, then! She
listened, resting upon one arm, with her face turned towards
the open doors. A clamour of voices was borne
from a distance to her ears. The new Terror had
begun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul!” she cried loudly. “Paul”; and a tall man
dressed in the robes of a Moor stood beside her bed.
She shrank away with a little scream. It was not
until he smiled that she recognized her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better get up, Marguerite,” he said, and
bending down he kissed her. “You have slept well,
thank the Lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the negresses brought her a cup of tea and
Marguerite, slipping on her dressing gown, sat upon
the edge of the bed and thrust her feet into her slippers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the time, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little past one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I let you sleep. There was no disturbance. The
first shot waked you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be quick,” she said, or rather began to say.
For the words, half-uttered, were frozen upon her lips.
Such a din, so shrill, so menacing and strange, burst
out above their heads that Marguerite cowered down
under it as under the threat of a blow. She had never
heard the like of it, she hoped never to hear the like of
it again; yet she was to hear it now for days—the
swift repetition of one strident note, swelling and falling
in a pæan of wild inhuman triumph. Marguerite
imagined all the birds of prey in the world wheeling
and screaming above the city; or a thousand thin voices
shrieking in a madhouse; you—you—you—you—you—the
piercing clamour ran swift as the clacking of a
mitrailleuse, and with a horrid ferocity which made
the girl’s blood run cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul,” she said, “what is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The women on the roofs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shuddered as she listened, clutching
tight her lover’s arm. Such a promise of cruelty was
in those shrill cries as made Marguerite think of the
little automatic pistol in the drawer of her table as a
talisman which she must henceforth carry close to her
hand. She felt that even if she escaped from the peril
of these days, she could never walk again in the narrow
streets between the blind houses without the chill of
a great fear. Her clasp tightened upon her lover’s
arm and he winced sharply. Marguerite looked up into
his face, and saw that his lips were pressed close together
to prevent a cry of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul!” she said wonderingly. She loosened her
clasp and turned back the sleeve of his djellaba. Beneath
it, his forearm was roughly but tightly bandaged.
“Oh, my dear,” she cried, in a voice of compunction,
“what happened to you whilst I slept? You
are wounded—and for me! Must I always do you
harm?” and she beat her hands together in her distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was an accident,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An accident?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran to her medicine-chest, and making him sit
beside her, unfastened the bandage. “An accident?”
she repeated. It looked to her as if he had been stabbed.
A knife had been driven right through the flesh of his
forearm. Paul did not reply to her exclamations and
she did not press her questions. She washed and
dressed the wound and bound it up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It must hurt terribly,” she said, her forehead
knitted in distress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is easier now,” he answered. “The knife was
clean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure of that, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made a sling of his arm and sent him away.
She dressed quickly, wondering how that wound had
been inflicted and why he wished not to explain it.
Surely he had not gone out whilst she slept? Surely
there had been no attack upon the house? No! But
she was plunged now into a world of mystery and
fear, and she wrung her hands in an impotent despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took their breakfast in a room upon the first
floor, Paul asking questions as to how far the house
was provisioned, and Marguerite answering almost at
random, whilst the cries of the women rang shrill overhead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, there is food,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can always send Selim out,” he added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite’s eyes lightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will send him out, Paul,” she exclaimed. “Do
you know what has been troubling me? We haven’t
a window upon any street. We are here at the bottom
of a well with nothing but our ears to warn us of
danger. We can see nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul looked at her anxiously. She was nervous,
the flutter of her hands feverish, and her voice running
up and down the scale as though she had no control
over it. Paul reached across the table and laid his
hand upon her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You poor little girl!” he said gently. “These are
trying days. But there won’t be many. The wireless
here will have got into touch already with Moinier’s
column near Meknes. The troops, too, at Dar-Debibagh
may do something,” and ever so slightly his voice
faltered when he spoke of the troops, yet not so slightly
but that Marguerite noticed it. “They have some
guns,” he went on hurriedly, and again Marguerite noticed
the hurry, the desire to cover up and hide that
little spasm of pain which had stabbed him when he
thought of his men. “Yes, the guns!” he said. “There
will be an end to that infernal twittering on the roof
tops when the guns begin to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, you should have been with your men,” said
Marguerite, and he answered her with a kind of violent
obstinacy which drew her eyes in one swift glance
to his face. “I am on leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He changed his tone, however, immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will send Selim into the town for news,” he
said cheerfully, “and we will go up on to the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selim was bidden to knock twice, and, after a tiny
interval, once more upon his return. Paul stood behind
the door listening to make sure that the tunnel
was empty before he opened it. Then he let him go,
and locked and barred the door again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said to Marguerite and, picking up some
cushions, they went upstairs to the roof. Marguerite
had followed Paul’s example, and was dressed in Moorish
clothes; the house was higher by a storey than any
which adjoined it, and the roof itself was enclosed in
a parapet waist-high. They crouched upon the cushions
behind the wall and cautiously looked over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pack of clouds was threatening in the west, but
just now the city glittered in the sunlight like a jewel,
with its hanging gardens and high terraces, its white
houses huddling down the hillside like a flock of sheep,
and the bright green tiles of its mosques. Paul and
Marguerite never tired of this aspect of the lovely
city, shut within its old crumbling walls and musical
with the rushing noise of its many rivers. But to-day
they saw it as they had never seen it before. For the
roofs were crowded with women in their coloured robes
of gauze and bright scarves, who danced and screamed,
and climbed from one house to another on little ladders
in such a frenzy of excitement that the eyes were dazzled
and the ears deafened. Paul turned towards the
north. Upon the roof of one house men were breaking
through with axes and picks, whilst others flung
down rags and sticks which had been soaked in paraffin
and lighted, through the holes into the rooms below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that’s the house of the French veterinary
surgeon,” said Paul; and from all about that house rose
a continuous rattle of firing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” said Paul, and he nodded to the south.
Here there was a gap between the houses, and Marguerite
could see far below a tumble-down stone bridge
built in a steep arch across a stream. As she looked,
a wild horde of men swarmed upon the bridge, capering
and yelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are soldiers amongst them,” said Marguerite.
“I can see their rifles and their bandoliers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the Askris who have revolted,” answered Paul,
and suddenly he covered Marguerite’s eyes with the
palm of his hand. “Don’t look!” But Marguerite had
already seen, and she sank down behind the parapet
with a moan. In the midst of that wild procession
some rifles with bayonets fixed were held aloft, and
on one of the bayonets the trunk and the limbs of a
man were impaled. The head was carried last of all,
and upon a pole taller than the bayonets, a head black
with blood, like a negro’s, on which a gold-laced kêpi
was derisively cocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul swore underneath his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of my brothers,” he whispered. “Oh, my
God,” and dropping his head into his hands, he rocked
his body to and fro in an agony of remorse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, there’s a carbine in your room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be fatal to use it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care,” Marguerite cried fiercely. Her face
was alive with passion. “Use it, Paul. I don’t care!”
and from far below there rose the sound of a loud
knocking upon a door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite’s heart fluttered up into her throat. She
stared at Paul with her eyes opened wide in horror.
The same thought was in both their minds. Both listened,
holding their breath that they might hear the
better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was upon our door they knocked,” Marguerite
whispered, and she crept a little closer to her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!” replied Paul, and as the knocking began
again, but this time louder, he added with a grim look
upon his face, “Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it was not Selim who knocked,” said Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They could hear cries now, angry orders to open,
followed by a muffled clamour and such a clatter of
heavy blows as shook the very house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go down,” said Paul, in a low voice.
“Otherwise they’ll break in the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite nodded. Her face was white to the lips,
but she was quite still now and her eyes steady. They
crept down to the uppermost floor of the house. The
noise was louder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will stay here, Marguerite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your pistol?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite drew it from her broad waistbelt of
gold brocade, snapped back the barrel, and set the
safety catch. Her hand never shook. Now that the
peril was at her elbow she could even smile. Paul
took her passionately in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are gold all through, Marguerite,” he cried.
“If this is the end, I thank you a thousand times. I
would hate to have died without knowing the wonder
of such rare love as yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘We two embracing under death’s spread hand.’ ”
She quoted from a book upon her shelf in which she
was pleased to find a whole library of wisdom and
inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will wait until the last moment?” said Paul,
touching the little automatic in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until they are on this last flight of stairs,” she
replied, in an even voice. “Paul!” She clung to him
for a second, not in terror, but as to some inestimable
treasure which she could hardly let go. Then she
stood away, her eyes shining like the dew, her face
hallowed with tenderness. “Now, my dear, go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel ran down the stairs. The clamour
echoing from the tunnel had taken on a fiercer note;
the door, stout as it was, bent inwards under the
blows. Marguerite, standing upon the landing, heard
him unbolt the door. She drew back out of sight as
a crowd of men, some in djellabas spotted with blood,
some in ragged caftans, some armed with rifles, others
with curved knives, others, again, with sharpened
poles, swept screaming like madmen over the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Frenchman,” cried a great fellow, brandishing
a butcher’s cleaver. “Give him to us! God has willed
that they shall all die this day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had become of Paul? she wondered. Had he
been swept off his feet and trampled down in the rush?
She heard his voice above the clamour. She imagined
him standing with uplifted hand claiming silence. At
all events, silence followed, and then his voice rang
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God willed that he should die yesterday,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite peered out between the curtains which
overhung the entrance to the room. She saw him
move, calm and smiling, across the court to an alcove
and point to a corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Frenchman came to my house once too often.
Look! He sought refuge here last night. He was
not wise to seek refuge in the house of Ben Sedira the
Meknasi. For to-day his body rolls in the river—”
Paul threw open a small door in the back wall and
showed them the Karouein River tumbling, swollen
with the rain, past the walls of his house. Then he
pointed to the alcove: “And his livery lies there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a rush into the alcove, and the shouts of
exultation broke out again. A blue tunic, on the
breast of which medals glinted and rattled, was tossed
out high amidst the throng. The tunic was gashed
and all cluttered and stained with blood which had
dried. Paul’s gold-lace cap spun through the air, was
caught, and clapped upon the head of a boy, his
breeches and boots and accoutrements were flung from
hand to hand and shared out amidst laughter and
cheering. And once more there was a surge of men,
and the court was empty and silent. No, not quite
empty. Paul was talking in a gentle voice to one wild
man who was now wearing over a ragged caftan Paul’s
uniform tunic. Paul held him firmly by the elbow,
and was speaking in a curiously soft, smooth voice,
than which Marguerite had never heard anything more
menacing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will leave that tunic, good friend. You will
take it off at once and leave it here. It is my trophy.
Have I not earned it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man protested, and sought to disengage himself,
but Paul still held him firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall hang in my house,” he continued, “that
my children may remember how once there were
Frenchmen befouling the holy ground of Morocco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more Marguerite heard the rattle of the medals
as the coat was restored, and the Moor cried out:
“There will be none alive in Fez this night. Salam
aleikum, O man of Meknes!” And a little afterwards
the door was slammed and barred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul returned to the court, holding the tunic in his
hands. The peril of the last few moments was swept
altogether out of his mind. For a moment Marguerite
herself was forgotten. He was holding the badge of
many years of honourable service, and the shining
medals which proved that the service had been of real
value to the country he served. All was now wasted
and foregone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should make the sacrifice again,” he said obstinately
to himself, “if it were to make again. I should!
I should!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had not borne to see the tunic and its medals
paraded in triumph on the back of one of these assassins
through the streets of Fez. When he stopped the
Moor and held him back from his companions, his
hand had gripped close the revolver hidden in his waistband.
Had the man clung to the tunic, Paul would
have killed, whatever the risk. The traditions and the
whole training of his life had forced his hand. He
knew that, as he stood in the silent sunlit patio fondling
the stuff of the coat between his fingers, and his
heart aching as though some little snake had slipped
into his bosom and was feeding there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have done what my father did,” he thought. “I,
who set out to atone for him.” And he laughed aloud
with so much mockery at his own pretensions that the
laughter startled him. “I can plead a different reason.
But what of that? I have done what my father did!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He folded the tunic reverently, and laid it down
again in the alcove. As he stood up he was startled
by the clatter of something falling overhead and the
sharp explosion of a pistol. He looked upwards. The
sound had come from behind those curtains where
Marguerite was hidden. Had she been watching?
Had she seen him fondling the tunic? Had she heard
his bitter laughter? Perhaps he had spoken aloud.
For a moment his heart stood still. Some words that
Henriette had said to him—oh, ever so long ago, in
the Villa Iris, flashed back into his mind. “Even if
the grand passion comes—oh la, la la!—she will blow
her brains out, the little fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang up the stairs, crying “Marguerite! Marguerite!”
and stumbling in his haste. No answer was
returned to him. He tore the curtains aside, and saw
her lying on the floor by the side of a divan. The
pistol had slipped from her hand and fallen a little
way from her. Paul flung himself upon his knees beside
her, lifted her, and pressed her close to his heart.
“Marguerite! Marguerite!” he whispered. There
was no wound, and she was breathing, and in a moment
or two her eyes opened. Paul understood in
that supreme moment of relief how greatly his love of
Marguerite overpowered his grief at honour lost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, you frightened me!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled as he lifted her onto the divan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was foolish,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had waited upon the outcome of that wild scene
in the court below, her nerves steady, her mind unconscious
of any effort to steel herself against catastrophe.
She could catch but a glimpse of what was going forward;
she did not understand the trick by which Paul
Ravenel had appeased the invaders; she heard the wild
babble of their frenzied voices and Paul’s voice over-topping
them. She had waited serenely with her little
pistol in her hand, safety to be reached so easily by the
mere pressure of a finger. Then suddenly all was
over; the court was empty, the house which had rung
with fury a moment since was silent; and as she heard
the bolts of the door shot once more into their sockets
her strength had melted away. She had stood for a
little while in a daze and, catching at the divan as she
fell, had slipped in a swoon to the floor. The pistol
fell from her hand and exploded as it fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was foolish,” she repeated; “I didn’t understand
what had happened. I don’t even now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was afraid that some time or another some one
had seen me enter this house and remembered it,” Paul
Ravenel explained. “Last night something happened
outside the door—what, I don’t know, but enough to
trouble me a little. So after you had gone to bed I
boiled a kettle—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I heard it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And sterilized my big knife. I drove the knife
through my arm and let the blood soak through my
tunic, and then I stabbed the tunic again in the back.
It was lucky that I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should I have done without you?” she said,
as she rested upon the cushions of the divan. She laid
a hand gently in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does the wound hurt, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It throbs a little if I move it. That’s all. It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll dress it again to-night,” she said, sleepily, and
almost immediately she fell asleep. She slept so deeply,
that a muffled roar, which shook the house, did not
even trouble her dreams. Paul smiled as he heard
that sound. “That’s one of the seventy-five,” he reflected.
The guns from the camp at Dar-Debibagh
were coming into action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left Marguerite sleeping, and climbed again to
the roof. The guns were firing to the south of the
town, and were still far away. But no man who had
fought through the Chaiouïa Campaign could ever forget
the tribesmen’s terror of the guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another day or two!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul counted up the stages of the march of Moinier’s
column from Meknes. If only he was quick, so that
the tribesmen could not mass between him and Fez!
There were houses alight now in Fez-el-Bali. The
work of massacre was going on. But let General
Moinier hurry, and the guns over there at Dar-Debibagh
talk insistently to Fez! Moreover, at five o’clock
the rain began again. It fell like javelins, with the
thunder of surf upon a beach.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch15'>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<h3>On the Roof Top</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>arguerite</span> drove her two trembling
negresses out of the corners into which they
had flown when the house was invaded, stood
over them while they cooked the dinner, and strictly
ordered that it should be served with the proper ceremonies.
She dressed herself in her European clothes
and with even more, to-night, of the scrupulous daintiness
which was habitual to her. Paul watched her
with a great pride and wonderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How in the world do you know at once what we
have to learn?” he asked. “When people are rattled,
routine’s the great remedy. Just doing the ordinary
things at the ordinary hours lifts you along with a
sort of assurance that life is going to be as sane to-morrow
as it was yesterday. But we have men to
watch, and they teach us these things. Where do you
get them from?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From myself,” answered Marguerite, with a blush
upon her cheeks, which her lover’s praise never failed
to provoke. “I had to keep my own little flag of
courage flying if I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At half past nine they heard Selim’s three knocks
upon the outer door, and Paul let him in and brought
him to Marguerite in the room opening on to the patio.
He brought with him a budget of black news. A
couple of officers had been dragged from their horses
and butchered in the streets. An engineer and his wife
in Fez Djedid had been shot down as they sat at their
luncheon. There had been an attack upon the Hôtel de
France, where the managress and a priest had been
slain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a house in the Tala quarter,” said Paul,
“where two veterinary surgeons and two other officers
lodged. I saw men breaking through the roof to get
at them this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They escaped, Sidi. They let themselves down
from a window into an alley. It is believed that they
are hiding in a covered drain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the four French telegraph operators. They,
too, occupied a house in the Tala.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selim had no good tidings to tell of them. The
door of their house had been forced at midday.
Throughout the afternoon they had resisted in an upper
room, which they had barricaded, firing with what
weapons they had until their ammunition was exhausted.
At seven in the evening a rescue party had
arrived, but only one of them was alive, and he grievously
wounded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rescue party!” asked Paul, wondering whence
that party had come. There was not enough men at
the headquarters in the hospital to do more than protect
the quarter of the Consulates, even if they could
do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A battalion from Dar-Debibagh forced its way
into the city at five o’clock this afternoon,” said Selim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul’s face took life, his eyes kindled. No one knew
better than he the difficulties which must have hampered
that exploit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was well done,” he cried. “Whose battalion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Algerian soldier replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Commandant Philipot’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gladness died out of Paul Ravenel’s face, and
he sat in silence staring at the tiles of the floor. To
Marguerite it was as though the light of a lamp waned
and flickered out. She laid her hand upon his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s your battalion, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul nodded, and whispered “Yes,” not trusting his
voice over much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have been with it, my dear. But for
me you would have led your company,” she said, remorsefully;
and he cried out aloud suddenly in a voice
which she had never heard him use before, a voice
rough and violent and full of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am on leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hearing him, she felt the compunction of one who
has carelessly knocked against a throbbing wound.
Her eyes went swiftly to his face. During these moments
Paul Ravenel was off his guard, and she was
looking upon a man in torture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The little Praslin will be leading my company,” he
said, “and leading it just as well as I could have done.”
He turned again to Selim. “Did the battalion have
trouble to get through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great trouble, Sidi. The commandant tried to
come in by the little gate in the Aguedal wall and the
new gardens of the Sultan. But he was attacked by a
swarm of men issuing from the Segma Gate on his left
flank and by sharp-shooters on the wall itself in front
of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we taught them to shoot!” cried Paul in exasperation.
“The commandant was held up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Sidi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then? He was losing men, and quickly.
What did he do?” Paul asked impatiently. His own
men were under fire. He had got to know, and at
once. “Out with it, Selim. What did the Commandant
Philipot do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He led his battalion down into the bed of the river
Zitoun,” said Selim, and a long “Oh!” of admiration
and relief from Paul welcomed the manœuvre. He
spread before his eyes, in mind, an imaginary map of
the difficult ground at that southwest corner of the city,
outside the walls. Pressed hardly upon his left flank,
at the mercy of the riflemen on the crest of the high,
unscalable wall of the Aguedal, Commandant Philipot,
leaving a rear-guard—trust the Commandant Philipot
for that!—had disappeared with his battalion into the
earth. Paul chuckled as he thought of it—the ingenuity
and the audacity, too!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He made for the Bab-el-Hadid?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” answered Selim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been risk, of course, risk of the gravest
kind. Out of shot, the battalion certainly was—out of
shot and out of sight. But, on the other hand, in the
deep chasm of the Oued Zitoun it could not see any
more than could its antagonists. If its rear-guard
was overwhelmed by the insurgents from the Segma
Gate, if a strong band of tribesmen rode up to the
southern lip of the chasm and caught the battalion
floundering below amongst the boulders and the swollen
river! Why, there was an end of that battalion and,
for the moment, of the relief of Fez. But he had got
through—there was the fact. And by no other way
and with no smaller risk could he have got through.
Paul Ravenel, watching that unprinted map upon the
floor, over which he bent, had no doubt upon that point.
A great risk nobly taken for a great end, and adroitly
imagined! And with what speed they must have covered
that difficult ground!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the little Praslin would lead very well,” he
said aloud, but with just a hint of effort in his cordiality.
“He knows his work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are on leave, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite was watching her lover with startled
eyes. But Paul noticed neither her look nor the urgent
appeal of her voice. He was away with his company
in the bed of the Oued Zitoun, now stumbling over the
great stones, now flung down headlong by the rush of
the rain-swollen torrent and pressing on again in the
hurried march. He sat tracing with his finger on the
tiles the convolutions of the river, the point where the
battalion must leave its shelter and march through the
gardens to the gates—lost to all else. And Marguerite,
watching him, caught at any reason which could reassure
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, Paul was unconsciously expressing the
regret of a true soldier that his company had gone upon
difficult and hazardous service without him, and a
soldier’s interest in a brilliant manœuvre successfully
accomplished. His absorption meant no more than
that. But—but—his cry, “I am on leave,” startled out
of him a challenge, an obstinate defiance, harsh with
pain, rang in her ears still, argue as she might. In
spite of herself, an appalling suspicion flickered like
lightning through her mind and went out—and flickered
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard Paul asking questions of Selim and Selim
answering. But she was asking of herself a question
which made all other questions of little significance.
If her suspicion were true, could his love for her remain?
Could it live strongly and steadily after so
enormous a sacrifice? Wouldn’t it die in contempt of
himself and hatred of her? If Paul Ravenel had
looked at Marguerite Lambert at this moment he
would have seen the haggard dancing girl of the Villa
Iris, as he had seen her under the grape-vine of the
balcony with her seven francs clenched in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul, however, was giving his attention to Selim.
The quarter of the hospitals and the Consulates was
now thought to be safe, though the Moors, uplifted
by their success, had planned to attack it that night.
An attempt had been made by a company of Philipot’s
battalion to force the Souk-Ben-Safi and its intricate,
narrow streets, but the company had been driven back.
A second company had been sent out to capture and
hold the Bab-el-Mahroud, but it was now beleaguered
and fighting for its life. Another section was at the
Bab Fetouh, in the south of the town, under fire from
the small mosque of Tamdert. A good many isolated
Europeans had been rescued from the houses, and
brought into the protected quarter, but Fez, as a whole,
was still in the hands of the insurgents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point Paul Ravenel broke in with a sharp
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You spoke to no one of this house?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selim shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To no one, Sidi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To none of the French soldiers? To no friend of
the French? You are sure, Selim? You are very
sure? There were no Europeans to be rescued from
this house? Answer me truthfully!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never was question more insistently expressed.
Why?—why?—why? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Marguerite found herself
asking whilst her heart sank. That their secret might
still be kept, its sweetness preserved for them? No,
that reason was inadequate. Why, then? Because the
danger was over? But it was not over. So much
Selim had made very clear. The few troops had been
withdrawn to the protected quarter of the Consulates.
The detachments outside were hard put to it. The
city of Fez was still in the hands of the insurgents.
Why then? Why the eagerness that the French
should know nothing of this secret house? Oh, there
was an answer, dared she but listen to it! An answer
with consequences as yet only dimly suspected. If it
was the true answer!—Marguerite sat stunned. How
was she to get away quite by herself that she might
think her problem out, without betraying the trouble
of her mind to Paul?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Paul himself who made escape easy for her.
He dismissed Selim and said to Marguerite:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go up on the roof, my dear, for a little while.
The rain has stopped, but, dressed as you are, it
wouldn’t be wise for you to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The excuse was feeble, and he spoke looking away
from Marguerite—a rare thing with him. But Marguerite
welcomed the excuse and had no eyes for the
shifty look of him as he made it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she said, in a dull voice, and Paul went
quickly up the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Selim’s story had moved him to the depths of his
soul. He was conscious of an actual nausea. “I should
make the sacrifice again.” He repeated a phrase which
had been growing familiar to him during this day, repeated
it with a stubborn emphasis. But he was beginning
to understand dimly what the sacrifice was to
cost him. Soldiering was his business in life. He was
sealed to it. He had known it when he stood in his
father’s death room on the islet off the coast of Spain;
and when he sat over Colonel Vanderfelt’s wine in the
dining room looking out upon the moonlit garden; but
never so completely as now when his thoughts were
with the men of his company stumbling in the river
bed, and his feet were dragging up the stairs to the
roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be alone for a little while, otherwise Marguerite
will guess the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an instinct rather than a formulated thought
which drove him upwards. He dreaded Marguerite’s
swift intuitions, that queer way she had of reaching
certainty, cleaving her way to it like a bird through the
air. He drew a long breath as he crept out upon the
roof. He was alone now, and, sinking down upon the
cushions underneath the parapet, he wrestled with his
grief, letting it have its way up here in the darkness so
that he might confine it the more surely afterwards.
For an hour on this first night of the revolt he remained
alone upon the roof-top whilst Marguerite,
separated from him by the height of the beleaguered
house, sat amongst the lighted candles in the room by
the court, steeling herself to a sacrifice which should
equal his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she was sure of herself she wrapped a dark
cloak about her shining frock and climbed in her turn
to the roof. But she moved very silently, and when
she raised her head above the trap she saw her lover
stretched upon the terrace, his turban thrown aside, his
face buried in his arms, his whole attitude one of almost
Oriental grief. He was unaware of her until she
crouched by his side and, with something maternal in
the loving pity of her hands, gently stroked his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul!” she whispered, and he sprang swiftly up.
She got a glimpse of a tortured face, and then he
dropped by her side and, putting his arms about her,
caught her to his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear! My dear!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul,” she began, in a breaking voice, but Paul
would not listen. He pointed his arm westwards over
the parapet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In their neighbourhood all was quiet, though here
and there a building was burning near enough to light
up from time to time their faces. But away in the
southwest a broad red glare canopied the quarter and
flames leapt and sank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that?” asked Marguerite, distracted from
her purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Mellah,” replied Paul. “They have looted and
burnt it. It’s the rule and custom. Whatever the
cause of an uprising, the Mellah is the first to suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had never set foot in that quarter. Paul
described it to her—its dirty and crowded alleys, its
blue-washed houses jammed together and packed with
rich treasures and gaudy worthlessness, gramophones
blaring out some comic song of London or Paris, slatternly
women and men, ten thousand of them, and then
the bursting in of the gates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Jews themselves! What has become of
them?” she asked, with a shudder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unarmed, pounded like sheep within their high walls,
they were likely to have been butchered like sheep, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a small new gate, however, leading to their
cemetery. They may have found that way free,” said
Paul, without any confidence. But, as a fact, they had
escaped whilst their houses were being plundered. The
gardens of the Sultan’s Palace, which adjoined, had
been swiftly thrown open to them, and at this very
moment they were camping there without food or
money or shelter—except the lucky ones who had made
little family groups in the empty cages of Mulai Hafid’s
menagerie between the lions and the jaguars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul”—Marguerite began a second time, but now
a rattle of firing and a distant clamour of fierce cries
broke out upon their left hand. Paul Ravenel turned
in the direction of the noise eagerly, and as Marguerite
turned with him, once more her attention was arrested.
From a semi-circle of streets a blaze of light across
which thick volumes of smoke drifted, rose above the
house-tops, so that the faces of the two watchers were
lit up as by a sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the attack upon the Consulates,” said Paul.
“It will fail. There are troops enough now to hold it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other side of the city, however, to the north,
it was a different matter. By the Bab-el-Mahroud the
French outpost was hard-pressed. Paul was listening
with all his intentness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds as if our ammunition was running short,”
he said, in a low, grave voice; and this time Marguerite
was not to be denied. Kneeling up, she caught Paul
by the arms as he sat, and turned him toward her.
The light, strong and bright, was sweeping across his
face in waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, is it true?” she asked, searching his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel had no need to ask what was true;
he had no heart to deny its truth. The thing which
most he dreaded had come to pass. Marguerite knew
what he had done. He had been certain that she knew
from the moment when she had laid her hand upon
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered, meeting her gaze. “It is true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not on leave!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have deserted!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul’s face twitched with a spasm of pain, but he
did not take his eyes from Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shook him gently as one might shake a
wayward child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can’t do that, Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have done it, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Paul—you can’t have understood what you
were doing! You can’t have thought!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have thought of everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have sacrificed your honour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your career.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have lost every friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I care about friend’s, Marguerite, when I
have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let go of his arms with such an expression of
grief and despair upon her face as cut him to the
heart to see. She bowed her forehead upon the palms
of her hands and burst into tears. Paul drew her
close to him, seeking to comfort her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be together, Marguerite, always. Yesterday
night, when I foretold you of these massacres—you
took it lightly because we were together. You
seemed to say nothing in the world mattered so long
as we were together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t you see, Paul”—she drew herself away
and raised her face, down which tears were running—“we
have been both of us alone to-night—already. You
here on the roof—I in the court below—and we wanted
to be alone, yes, my dear—why deny it, since I know?
We wanted to be alone, each of us with our miserable
thoughts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In a little while you’ll hate me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said, violently. “That could never be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent her head over his hands and pressed them
to her eyes, wetting them with her tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul,” she whispered between her sobs, “I can’t
take such a sacrifice. Oh, my dear, you should have
left me with my seven francs and my broken bundle
on that balcony in Casablanca.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul stooped and kissed her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, I wouldn’t have left you there for anything
in the world. From the moment I saw you there
was no world for me, except the world in which you
and I moved step by step and hand-in-hand.”</p>

<div><h1 id='ch16'>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<h3>Marguerite’s Way Out</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>G</span>radually</span> the attack upon the Consulates
died away. The waving light from the blaze
of torches in the ring of streets about that
quarter diminished, and darkness came again to the
watchers upon the roof top. They sat huddled together
in silence. Marguerite’s broken sobbing had ceased.
Above them the bright stars wheeled in a sky of velvet.
Only away to the north, where the beleaguered post still
held out at the Bab-el-Mahroud, was there now any
sound of firing, or any faint clamour of voices. The
troubled city rested, waiting for daylight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul became conscious that Marguerite was stirring
out of the abandonment of grief in which she had lain.
He felt her supple body stiffen in his arms. Some
idea, some plan perhaps, had occurred to her of which
he must beware; all the more because she did not speak
of it. He was pondering what that plan might be,
when above their heads, in their very ears it seemed,
the first mueddin on the balcony of his minaret launched
over the city his vibrant call to prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound startled them both so that they clung together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move,” whispered Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Companions of the Sick!” said Marguerite, in
a low voice. “My dear, we shall need them to-night as
much as any two in Fez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They waited for a few moments. Then they crept
swiftly and silently to the hatchway and closed it above
their heads. In Marguerite’s room Paul lighted the
candles. Marguerite was wearing the little frock of
white and silver in which she had dressed the night
before, and she let the dark cloak slip from her shoulders
and fall about her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul,” she said, joining her hands together upon
her breast in appeal. “I want you to do something—for
me. You can walk safely through the streets.
Dressed as you are, no one will know you. No one
will suspect you. If you are spoken to, you can answer.
You are Ben Sedira the Meknasi. I want you
to go at once to the Protected quarter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, Marguerite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can rejoin your battalion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can, Paul! You can make yourself known.
They will let you through their barricades.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is too late,” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite would not accept the quiet statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she pleaded, her eyes eager, her mouth
trembling. “I have been thinking it out, my dear, up
there on the roof. You can make an excuse. You
were seized yesterday night after you had visited the
Headquarters. You were pulled from your horse.
You were kept imprisoned and escaped to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one would believe that story, Marguerite.
The people of Fez are making no prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you took refuge in the house of a friend!
You have many friends in Fez, Paul. A word from
you and any one of them will back you up and say he
gave you shelter. It’ll be so easy, Paul, if you’ll only
listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And meanwhile, Marguerite, what of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was waiting for that question with her answer
ready upon her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I have thought of that too, Paul. I shall be
quite safe here now by myself. They have searched
this house already. They went away satisfied with
your story. They will not come here again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul smiled at her tenderly. She stood before him
with so eager a flush upon her face, a light so appealing
in her eyes. Only this morning—was it so short
a time ago as this morning?—yes, only this morning
she had been terrified, even with him at her side, because
they were shut in within this house without windows,
because they could see nothing, know nothing,
and must wait and wait with their hearts fluttering at
a cry, at the crack of a rifle, at the sound of a step.
Now her one thought was to send him forth, to endure
alone the dreadful hours of ignorance and expectation,
to meet, if needs must, the loneliest of deaths, so that
his honour might be saved and his high career retained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are thinking too much of me, Marguerite,” he
said, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am thinking of myself, my dear, just as much as
I am thinking of you. I am thinking of your love for
me. What am I without it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing will change that,” protested Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite smiled wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, how many lovers have used and listened
to those words? Is there one pair that hasn’t? I am
looking forward, Paul, to when this trouble is over—to
the best that is possible for us two if we are alive
when it is over. Your way! Flight, concealment for
the rest of our lives and a bond of disgrace to hold us
together instead of a bond of love which has done no
harm to any one and has given a world of happiness to
both of us. Paul, my way is the better way! Oh, believe
it and leave me! Paul, I am pleading for myself—I
am!—and”—the light went out of her eyes, her
head and her body drooped a little; he had never seen
anything so forlorn as Marguerite suddenly looked—“and,
oh, ever so much more than you imagine!” she
added, wistfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took her by the arm which hung listlessly at
her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, I can invent no story which would save
me. The first shot was fired at noon to-day, not yesterday.
Nothing can alter that. And even if it could
be altered, I won’t leave you to face these horrors
alone. I brought you to Fez—don’t let us forget that!
I hid you in this house. My place is here with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But whilst he was speaking Ravenel had a feeling
that he had not reached to the heart of the plan which
she had formed upon the roof. The sudden change in
her aspect, the quick drop from eager pleading to a
forlorn hopelessness, the wistful cry, “I am pleading
for myself ever so much more than you imagine!”—No,
he had not the whole of her intention. There was
more in her mind than the effort to persuade him to
leave her. There was a provision, a remedy, if persuasion
failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul let her arm go and drew back a step or two until
he leaned against a table of walnut wood set against
the wall. Marguerite turned to the dressing-table and
stood playing absently with her little ornaments, her
brushes, and her combs. Then she surprised him by
another change of mood. The eager, tender appeal,
the sudden hopelessness were followed now by a tripping
flippancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy your caring so much for me, Paul!” she
cried, and she tittered like a schoolgirl. “A little dancing
thing from the Villa Iris! I am not worth it. Am
I, Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to him, soliciting “Yes” for an answer,
smiling with her lips though she could not with her
eyes, and keeping these latter lowered so that he should
not see them. “Well, since your silence tells me so
politely that I am, I’ll give up trying to persuade you
to leave me.” She yawned. “I am tired to death,
Paul. I shall sleep to-night. And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cocked her head on one side with a coquettish
gaiety, false to her at any time, and never so false to
her as now. To Paul, whose memory had warned him
for the second time that day, it was quite dreadful to
see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall watch in the court below,” he said, and
he moved a step or two away from the little table
against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go, or I shall fall asleep where I stand,” said
Marguerite, and she led him to the wide doors opening
on to the landing. “I shall leave the doors open, so
that you will be within call.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him a little push which was more of a
caress than a push, and suddenly caught him back to
her. Her eyes were raised now, her arms were about
his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul,” she whispered, and both eyes and lips were
smiling gravely, “whatever happens to me, my dear,
I shall owe you some wonderful months of happiness.
Months which I had dreamed of, and which proved
more wonderful than any dreams. Thank you, dear
one! Thank you a thousand times!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him upon the lips and laid her hand upon
his cheek and stood apart from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel answered her with a curious smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might be saying good-bye to me, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shook her head with determination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never say good-bye to you, Paul, not even
if this very second we were to hear the assassins surging
up the stairs,” she said, her eyes glowing softly
into his, and a sure faith making her face very beautiful.
“We have broken codes and laws, my dear, both
of us. But we have both touched, I think, in spite of
that, something bigger and finer than we had either of
us believed was here to touch. And I don’t believe
that—you and I”—she made a little gesture with her
hand between herself and him—“the miracle as you
called it, of you and me can end just snapped off and
incomplete. Why, my dear, even if we go right back
to earth, at the very worst, I believe,” she said, with a
smile of humour, “some spark of you will kindle some
dry tinder of me and make a flame to warm a luckier
pair of lovers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul looked at her in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You talk to me like that!” he said, at length. “And
then you try to persuade me you weren’t worth while.”
He turned the moment of emotion with a laugh.
“Good-night, Marguerite,” and he went downstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite waited without moving whilst he descended
the stairs and crossed the court. She heard
him pass into the room with the archway and the
clocks. He was quite invisible to her now. Therefore,
so was she to him; and she was standing very close to
the doors; just within her bedroom—no more. She
stepped back silently. There were rugs upon the floor,
and between the rugs she stepped most carefully lest
one of the heels of her satin shoes should clack upon the
boards. She went straight to the little table of walnut
wood set against the wall and laid her hand upon the
drawer. The handle was of brass; she lifted it so that
it should not rattle, and so stood with an ear towards
the stairway, listening. But no sound came from the
court, there was not a creak of any tread on the stairs.
Reassured, Marguerite pulled open the drawer a little
way. The table had been fashioned in a century when
tables really were made. The drawer slid out smoothly
and noiselessly just far enough for Marguerite’s hand
to slip through the opening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her fingers, however, touched nothing. She opened
the drawer wider. It was empty. Yet it had not been
empty that evening when she had changed her clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul was standing here,” she said to herself. “Yes,
facing me with his back to the table, whilst I was talking
to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remembered now that when she had thrown her
arms about his neck, as he stood in the doorway, he
had kept his left hand behind his back. She sat down
upon the edge of the bed, and a smile flitted across her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have known that he would have understood,”
she whispered. He always had understood
from the first moment when, without a word, he had
called her to him at the Villa Iris. But Marguerite
must make sure. She stole out on to the landing.
From the point where she stood she could look down
and across the court into the room with the clocks.
Paul was lying upon the cushions in a muse, looking
at something which lay darkly gleaming on the out-stretched
palm of his hand—her little automatic pistol.
He had cleaned it and reloaded it and replaced it in the
drawer that afternoon, after Marguerite had fainted
and it had exploded on the floor. He had taken it out
of the drawer when Marguerite was bidding him good-bye
a few minutes back. For, mingled with her words,
another and a coarser voice had been whispering in his
ears. “And if it comes—the grand passion! She will
blow her brains out—the little fool!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not from disillusionment, as Henriette with her bitter
experience of life expected, but to save him, Paul
Ravenel, to set him free, whilst there was still perhaps
a chance that by some deft lie he might hold on to his
career and his good name. “That, no!” said Paul, and
he pushed the pistol into his waistbelt and composed
himself for his long vigil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The candles burned down, and one by one flickered
out; mueddin succeeded mueddin in the minaret; but
for their voices the town was quiet; Paul Ravenel tired
with the anxiety, the sleeplessness, and the inward conflicts
which through thirty hours had been his share,
nodded, dozed, and in the end slept. He woke to find
the grey of the morning thinning the shadows in the
house, making it chill and eerie and an abode of ghosts.
Surely a ghost was stirring in the house with a little
flutter and hiss of unsubstantial raiment, a ripple of
silver and fire—there by the balustrade above the patio,
now on the stairs.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And now Paul Ravenel,
though he did not move, was wide awake, watching
from his dark corner with startled eyes. Marguerite
was on the stairs, now stopping to peer over towards
her lover, lest he should have moved, now most stealthily
descending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last mueddin had ceased his chant, a hum of
voices rose through the still air without the house; the
city was waking to another day of massacre. And
Marguerite was creeping down the stairs. She had not
gone to bed that night, after all. She was still wearing
her white frock with the embroidery of silver. She
had thrown over her shoulders a glistening cloak. She
had put on the jewels he had given her. They sparkled
in the dim light on her bosom—a square sapphire hung
on a chain of platinum and diamonds which went
about her neck—on her wrists, on her shoes, at her
waist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Why?” he asked of himself; and as Marguerite
reached the foot of the stairs and stepped into
the court, he had the answer to his question. For
something gleamed in her hand—the great key of the
street door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel was just in time. For with the swiftness
and the silence of the ghost he had almost taken
her to be, Marguerite flashed across the patio, and was
gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite!” he cried aloud, as he sprang to his
feet, so that the house rang with his cry. A sob, a
wail of despair answered him, a clink as the heavy key
dropped from her startled hands. He found her blindly
fumbling at the bolts, distraught with her need of
haste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, let me go! Let me go!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted her in his arms as one lifts a child and carried
her back into the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite!” he whispered. “A step outside that
tunnel dressed as you are, now that Fez is awake,
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, I know,” she interrupted him. “I should
be out of your way altogether. Oh, Paul, let me go!
I have been thinking of it all night. I can’t take, all
the time, and everything you have that’s dear to you!
Let me give too—something in return—my life, my
dear, that’s worth so little. Oh, Paul, let me give it
now, when I am ready to give it—before my courage
goes,” and she struggled and beat upon his breast with
her small fists in a frenzy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he held her close to him. “Poor child, what a
night of horror she must have lived through,” he reflected.
Lying on her bed in the dark, waiting for the
first gleam of dawn, for the first sounds of the city’s
awakening, and shutting her eyes and her ears against
the terror of these savage and wild-eyed fanatics, forbidding
her heart to sink before the ordeal of her great
sacrifice. She had decked herself out in her jewels,
like that bride of whom she had told him, but for a
different reason; that she might the sooner attract notice
and invite murder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was mad, Marguerite!” he cried, and then, holding
her to his heart. “But it was splendid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already her strength was waning. She no longer
struggled. She hung in his arms. Her hands stroked
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go, Paul,” she pleaded, “won’t you? It
will be quick. The first of them who sees me! Oh,
while I can do it. My dear, my dear, I’ll gladly die
for you, I love you so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick?” exclaimed Paul Ravenel, savagely. “You
don’t know them! I have seen our men on the battlefields.
Quick? My dear, they would bind you hand
and foot and give you to their women to mutilate
alive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite uttered a cry and struggled against him
no more. He carried her up the stairs, undressed her,
and put her to bed. She laid her hand in his. He
would have his way. She gave herself into his keeping
and, holding fast on to his hand, she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That morning the roar of the guns was louder, and
the shells were flying over the city.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch17'>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<h3>The Outcasts</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hat</span> day, the eighteenth of April, broke in
gloom. A heavy canopy of sullen clouds hung
over Fez. Nowhere within eye’s reach was
there a slant of sunshine. There were no shadows, no
flashes of colour. White houses and dark gardens and
green-tiled mosques all lay very clear and near and distinct,
but without any of the radiance which on a day
of sunlight gives to the city so magical a beauty, that a
stranger looking down upon it can believe that he has
wandered into fairyland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shells were screaming over Fez from the south.
They dispersed the Moors holding the North Fort outside
the walls, and they destroyed the Castle of Sidi
Bou Nafa in Fez Djedid, close to the Sultan’s Palace,
which was held in force by the insurgents. But there
were too many refugees still hiding and too many Fazi
secretly friendly to the French to make possible such a
bombardment as would reduce the city to terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The insurgents were still in possession of every
quarter of the town except the Sultan’s Palace and the
district of the Embassy and Consulates. The little post
at the Bab-el-Mahroud had been exterminated during
the night. The company of which that post had been
a section, under Captain Henry, subsequently to be
famous as a general upon a wider field, was fighting its
way desperately back in the Souk Senadjine. Another
company sent to join hands with him and occupy the
quarter of Tala was held up in the Souk-Ben-Safi; and
the post at the southern gate of Bab Fetouh was in
desperate straits. The only gleam that morning was
the rescue of the guests besieged in the Hôtel de France
under the covering fire of a platoon stationed on the
roof of the British Consulate. The screams of the
women indeed shrilled from the terraces with a fiercer
exultation than even on the outbreak of the rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite woke later to the sound of them. She
held her hands over her ears and called loudly to Paul:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to look at your arm,” she said, when he ran
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s going on finely. It can wait until you are
dressed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped her legs out of bed and sat on the edge
of it, thrusting her feet into her slippers. She wanted
to do something at once which would take her thoughts
from that piercing and inhuman din. Paul brought to
her the medicine-chest and she dressed and bandaged
the half-healed wound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Marguerite. I’ll tell them to get your
bath ready,” he said, as he turned to go. But the
screaming overhead made her blood run cold. She
could endure the roar of the seventy-fives, the rattle
of musketry, even the wild yelling of the men; but this
cruel frenzy of the gaily-dressed women upon the
house-tops, never tiring whilst daylight lasted, shocked
her as something obscene, the screaming of offal-birds,
not women, a thing not so much unnatural as an accusation
against nature and the God that made nature.
She quickly called her lover back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, you took my little pistol from the drawer of
my table there last night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said Paul, looking at her in doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to give it back to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You need not fear,” she continued. “Yesterday I
meant to use it—for your dear sake as I thought—or
rather for both our sakes. But since you will keep me
with you—why, all that’s over and I shall not use it unless
there is real need. Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted her hand and, as she listened, shuddered.
“You spoke of those women this morning. What they
would do to me. I should feel—safe if you would give
my pistol back to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took it from his belt and laid it on the flat of
her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” she said, with a sigh of relief. She
sat on the edge of the bed, her hair tumbled about her
shoulders, smiling at this little weapon which could
make death swift and easy, like a child delighted with
a new toy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things which make the flesh crawl and the spirit
shudder have sometimes a curious and dreadful fascination.
All through their luncheon these strident
cries called to Marguerite, drew her like some morbid
vice. She wanted to creep up on to the roof, to crouch
behind the parapet, though she knew that her heart
would miss its beats and her senses reel on the edge of
terror. And when Paul Ravenel said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, I shall lie down on my bed and sleep
when we have finished,” she realized that it was her
own wish which he was uttering. She was almost disappointed
when he lit a cigar. A cigarette, yes; but a
cigar! That needs a deal of smoking. “You’ll wake
me if there’s need,” said Paul. “I think that I shall
sleep soundly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite noticed the heaviness of his eyelids, and
was filled with compunction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I must,” she answered, determining that whatever
happened he who had hardly slept at all for fifty
hours should sleep his sleep out now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet within an hour she had waked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly, indeed, had Paul’s eyes closed before she
climbed to the roof. The terraces of the houses were a
very kaleidoscope of shifting colours. Orange, scarlet,
deep waistbelts of cloth of gold over dresses of purple
and blue and pink were grouped in clusters here like
flower beds. There the women moved in and out with
frantic gestures like revellers in Bedlam. And over all
the shrill vibrant pæan like a canopy!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite watched and listened, shivering—until
one house caught and riveted her eyes. Beneath her
flowed the Karouein river. The farther bank was
lined with the walls of houses, and about one, a little to
Marguerite’s right, there was suddenly a great commotion.
Marguerite lifted her head cautiously above the
parapet and looked down. A narrow path ran between
the houses and the stream, and this path was suddenly
crowded with men as though they had sprung from the
earth. They beat upon the door, they fired senselessly
at the blind mud walls with rifles, they shouted for admittance.
And the roof of that one house was empty.
Marguerite was suddenly aware of it. It was the only
empty roof in all that row of houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shouts from the path were redoubled. Orders
to open became screams of exultation, threats of vengeance.
Marguerite, looking down from her high vantage
point, saw the men upon the pathway busy like
ants. A group of them clustered suddenly. They
seemed to stoop, to lengthen themselves into line—and
now she saw what they were lifting. A huge square
long beam of wood—a battering ram? Yes, a battering
ram. Three times the beam was swung against the
door to the tune of some monotonous rhythm of the
East, which breathed of deserts and strange temples
and abiding wistfulness, curiously out of keeping with
the grim violence which was used. At the fourth blow
the door burst and broke. It was as though a river
dam had broken and a river torrent leapt in a solid
shaft through the breach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a few moments thereafter nothing was seen by
Marguerite. The walls of the house were a curtain between
her and the tragic stage. She could only imagine
the overturning of furniture, the pillage of rooms a
moment since clean and orderly, now a dirty wreckage,
a pandemonium of a search—and then the empty roof
was no longer empty. A man sprang out upon it, a
man wearing the uniform of a French officer. He had
been bolted like a rat by dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly his enemies were upon his heels. Marguerite
saw him spring over the parapet on to the adjoining
roof and a cloud of women assail him. Somehow he
threw them off, somehow he dived and dodged between
them, somehow he reached the further parapet, found
a ladder propped against the outside wall, and slid
down it on to a third housetop. And as he reached
the flat terrace, yet another swarm of screaming termagants
enveloped him. He was borne down to the floor
of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a little while there was a wild tossing of arms,
a confusion of bodies. It seemed to Marguerite as
though all these women had suddenly melted into one
fabulous monster. Then, with shrieks of joy and flutterings
of scarves and handkerchiefs, they stood apart,
dancing flatly on their feet. The officer for his part
lay inert and for the best of reasons; he was bound
hand and foot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And shortly afterwards the
women lighted a fire.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A fire?” said Marguerite, in a perplexity. “Why
a fire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She watched—and then she heard the dreadful loud
moan of a man in the extremity of pain. In a moment
she was shaking Paul Ravenel by the shoulder, her face
white and quivering, her eyes still looking out in horror
upon a world incredible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul! Paul! Wake up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ravenel came slowly out of a deep sleep, with a
thought that once more the insurgents were about his
door. But a few stammering words from Marguerite
brought him quickly to his feet. He unlocked a cupboard
and took from it a carbine in a canvas case. He
slipped off the case and fitted a charged magazine beneath
the breech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will wait here, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst he was speaking he was already on the stair.
Marguerite could not wait below as he had bidden her.
This horror must end. She must know, of her own
knowledge, that it had ended. She followed Paul as
far as the mouth of the trap, and came to a stop there,
her feet upon the stairs, her head just above the level
of the roof. The groans of the tortured man floated
across the open space mingled with the triumphant
screams of the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, hurry, Paul, hurry,” she cried, and she heard
him swear horribly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The oath meant less than nothing to her. Would he
never fire? He was kneeling behind the parapet,
crouching a little so that not a flutter of his haik
should be visible, with the barrel of his carbine resting
upon the bricks. Why didn’t he fire? She stamped
upon the stairs in a frenzy of impatience. She could
not see that the women were perpetually shifting and
crossing about their victim and obscuring him from
Paul Ravenel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last a moment came when the line of sight was
clear; and immediately the carbine spoke—once and no
more; and all about her in this upper city of the air all
noises ceased, groans, exultations, everything. It was
to Marguerite as though the crack of that carbine had
suspended all creation. In a few seconds the shrill
screams broke out again, but there could be no doubt
about their character. They were screams of terror.
These, in their turn, dwindled and ceased. Had Marguerite
raised her head above the parapet now she
would have seen that those terraces so lately thronged
were empty except one on which a fire was burning,
and where one man in a uniform lay quite still and at
peace with a bullet through his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Marguerite was watching Paul, who had sunk
down below the edge of the parapet and was gazing
upwards with startled eyes. Marguerite crept to his
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul pointed. Just above their heads a tiny wisp
of smoke coiled and writhed in the air like an adder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that were seen—” said Paul, in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If that tiny wisp from the smokeless powder of his
cartridge were seen floating in the air, there would be
no doubt from what roof the shot had been fired. Paul
drew Marguerite down beside him; together they
watched. There was no wind at all; the air was sluggish
and heavy; it seemed to them that the smoke was
going slowly to curl and weave above their heads for
ever. It grew diaphanous, parted into fine shreds,
tumbled, and at last was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two lovers looked at one another with a faint
smile upon their lips. But they did not move; they
crouched down, seeing nothing but the empty sky above
their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The danger was not past. At any moment the sound
of blows upon their door might resound again through
the house. Or they might hear a ladder grate softly
on the outside of this parapet, as it was raised from
one of the roofs below. They waited there for half
an hour. Then a shell screamed above their heads and
exploded. It was followed by another and another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are shelling the Souk-Ben-Safi,” said Paul.
“Look! You can see the twinkle of the guns.” He
pointed out to her the flashes on the hills to the east
of the town. “That’s the way! Let the guns talk to
these torturers!” He shook his fist over the town,
standing upright now upon the roof, his face aflame
with anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul! Paul!” Marguerite cried in warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no one to see,” he returned, with a savage
laugh. “One shell in the Souk-Ben-Safi and they’re
shivering in their cellars. Come, let us go down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an hour the shells screeched above the roof, and
Paul, as he cleaned his carbine, whistled joyously. He
raised his head from his task to see Marguerite, very
white in the face, clinging to her chair with clenched
hands, and trying in vain to whistle too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a brute,” he cried, in compunction. “They
won’t touch this house, Marguerite! It’s too near the
Karouein Mosque. The French are going to stay in
Morocco. They’ll not touch the Karouein Mosque.
There’s no spot in Fez safer from our guns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite professed herself reassured, but it did
occur to her that gunners and even guns might make
occasionally a mistake, and she drew a very long
breath of relief when the bombardment ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel, however, fell into a restless mood,
pacing the court, and now and again coming to a stop
in front of Marguerite with some word upon his lips,
which, after all, he did not speak. Marguerite guessed
it, and after a little struggle made herself his interpreter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bombardment’s over. It will keep Fez quiet
for awhile. Even if that wisp of smoke was seen, no
crowd will come here for an explanation—yet, at all
events. Why don’t you go outside into the town and
get the news?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eager light in his eyes told her clearly that she
had interpreted him aright. But Paul, not knowing
the reason which had prompted her, sought for another.
He looked at Marguerite warily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gave you back your pistol,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I promised not to use it,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shifted from one foot to the other, anxious for
news, eager, after his two days’ confinement in this
shell, for action, yet remorseful for his eagerness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t be fair,” he said, half-heartedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want you to go,” she answered, with a glimmer
of a smile at this man turned shamefaced school-boy
who stood in front of her. “You’re wild to go
really, Paul, and I am in no danger.” She drew a
swift breath as she said that and hoped that he would
not notice it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am restless, Marguerite,” he said in a burst.
“I’ll tell you why? Do you know what I did on the
roof? What I had to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You frightened the women away—shot one of
them—put an end to their fiendishness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would have been no use, my dear. The man,
a brother-officer of mine, would still have lain upon
that roof in torture and helpless. They would have
left him there till dark and finished their work then, if
he were still alive. Can you guess what they were
doing? They were burning his head slowly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had a vision of herself rushing out into
the street as only that morning she had proposed to do,
and meeting the same fate. She covered her eyes with
her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, dear. I had to tell you, because I have
to tell you this too. I killed him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite took her hands from her face and stared
at her lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had to,” said Paul, in a dull voice. “There was
no other way to save him. But, of course, it”—and he
sat down suddenly with his hands clenched together
and his head bowed—“it troubles me dreadfully.
Who he was I don’t know; his face was blackened with
the fire. But he may have served with me in the
Chaiouïa—he may have marched up with me to Fez—we
may have sat together on many nights over a camp
fire, telling each other how clever we were—and I had
to kill him, just as one puts a horse out of its misery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear,” said Marguerite. She was at his
side with her arm about his shoulders—comforting
him. “I didn’t understand. You could do nothing
else. And you were quick. He would be the first to
thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took the hand that was laid upon his shoulders
gratefully. “No, I could do nothing else,” he said.
“But I want to move, so that I mayn’t think of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made light of her own isolation in that house.
Paul, it was plain to her, was in a dangerous mood.
Horror at the thing which he had been forced to do,
anger at the stroke of fate which had set him to the
tragic choice between his passion and his duty, bitterness
against the men in power who had refused to listen,
were seething within him. He was in a mood to
run riot in a berserk rage at a chance word, a chance
touch, to kill and kill and kill, until he in turn was
borne down and stamped to death. But Marguerite
stood aside. One appeal—it would be enough if only
her eyes looked it—and without a doubt he would stay.
Yes, stay and remember that he had been stayed! She
did not even bid him take care or hurry back to her.
She called Selim and bade him stand by the outer
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul took a great staff in his hand and came back to
Marguerite, and kissed her on the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” he said. “How you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pay my little price, Paul, for a very big love,”
and as was her way, she turned off the moment of
emotion with a light word and a laugh. “There! Run
along, and mind you don’t get your feet wet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three hours thereafter she sat alone in the court,
with her pistol in her hand, paying her little price; outside
the noise of a town in tumult, inside the ticking of
a clock. And darkness came.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had her reward. Paul Ravenel returned
at eight o’clock, his robes covered with dust and mud,
his body tired, but his black mood gone. He dressed
himself after his bath in the grey suit of a European,
and as they sat at dinner he gave Marguerite his good
news. The back of the rebellion was broken. The
tribes which were gathering in the South and East of
the town had been dispersed by the artillery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moinier and his column will be here before they can
gather again. They were the great danger, Marguerite.
For if they had once got into Fez they would have
looted it from end to end. Friend’s house or enemy’s
house, Fasi or Christian, would have been all the same
to those gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rising was premature. That had been the cause
of its failure. The quarter of the Consulates and the
Embassy had not been carried by storm on the first
day. A number of the Askris who had joined the insurgents
under fear, were now returning to their duties.
The great dignitaries of the Maghzen were in a hurry
to protest their loyalty by returning the few wounded
prisoners and such dead bodies of the French soldiers
as they could collect, to the headquarters at the Hospital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s still a post very hard-pressed at the Bab
Fetouh. An effort was made to relieve it this afternoon—”
Paul Ravenel broke off abruptly with a sudden
smile upon his face and a light of enjoyment in his
eyes. “I expect that they will try now from Dar-Debibagh
outside the walls. It should be easier that way,”
he said hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something had happened that afternoon of which
he had not told Marguerite, and to which he owed his
high spirits. Marguerite was well aware of it. She
had not a doubt that he was hiding from her some rash
act of which he was at once rather ashamed and very
glad; and it amused her to note how clever he thought
himself in concealing it from her. What had happened
in that attempt to relieve the post at the Bab Fetouh?
Marguerite did not ask, having a fine gift of silence.
She had Paul back safe and sound, and the worst of
their dangers was over. They were gay once more
that night, looking upon it as a sort of sanctuary between
the dangers of the past two days and the troubles
which awaited them in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go up on the roof?” Marguerite asked,
looking at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will go halfway up to the roof,” replied Paul,
and Marguerite laughed as he put out the candles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next day the rebellion was over. A battalion
from Meknes with a section of mitrailleuses marched
in at three o’clock in the afternoon, having covered the
sixty-five kilometres in a single stage. An order was
given that every house which wished to avoid bombardment
must fly the tricolour flag on the following morning,
and Fez was garnished as for a festival. Never
was there so swift a change. On every housetop daybreak
saw the flag of France, and though the women
thronged the terraces as yesterday, they were as silent
as the bricks of their parapets. By a curious chance
the pall of sullen rain-charged clouds, which for four
days had hung low, was on this morning rolled away,
and the city shimmered to the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul and Marguerite watched the strange spectacle,
hidden behind their roof wall; and their thoughts were
busy with the same question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What of us now—the outcasts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul looked across the city to Fez Djedid and the
East. From that quarter General Moinier’s column
was advancing. One day—two days perhaps—three
days at the most, and it would be here at the Bab
Segma. There was little time!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to find Marguerite’s eyes swimming in
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul, can nothing be done to give you back your
own place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, Marguerite. Let us face it frankly! I
went to Headquarters and warned them. Therefore
I knew the danger. All the more, therefore, my place
that night was with my company. Nothing can get
over that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite with a sob buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I have cost you, Paul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What you have given me, Marguerite!” he replied,
and fell into a silence. When he spoke to her again he
spoke with his eyes averted from her face, lest she
should read more than he meant her to in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, Marguerite, you have done no wrong.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We have got to consider that, my dear. There
isn’t really any reason why you should pay too. You
wanted to take the risk.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The certainty, Paul, as it turned out. I should not
be in the sunshine on this roof now if you had listened
to me,” she interrupted; but Paul was not to be led
aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I mean is that you are not responsible. I
am, I alone. Therefore, there’s no reason why you
should cut yourself off from all the things which make
life lovely,” he continued. “For it means that, my
dear. All the things which make life lovely will go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Except one,” said Marguerite, quietly, “and that
one outweighs all the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still Paul would not turn to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think well, Marguerite!” and he spoke without stirring,
in a level, toneless voice, so that no spark of his
desire might kindle her to a sacrifice which, after days,
monotonous and lonely, would lead her bitterly to regret.
“Think carefully! You can travel in a little
while to the coast. You can go home. No one can
gainsay you. You will not be poor any more. In a
few years you will be able to look back upon all this as
a dream.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, Paul!” she said, in a low voice. “You hurt
me. You make me ashamed. How could I go home
and live, leaving you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what hurt and shamed her most, she could not
tell him. It was the knowledge that this hero of hers,
this—her man who could do no wrong, had done such
wrong for her that he was now an outcast who must
dodge and duck his head, and slink unrecognized in the
shadows. Her pain, however, was evident enough in
the quiver of her voice and the tight clasp of her hand
upon his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at me, Paul!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She waited until he had turned, and her great eyes,
dewy and tender, rested upon his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where you go, I go. That was settled for us at
the Villa Iris on the night we met, perhaps even before
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul argued no more. He was kneeling in front of
her upon a cushion. He took her two hands, and, lifting
them, he bowed his head and pressed the palms
against his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let us go down and make our plans,” he said.
“For what we do, we must do very quickly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His urgency startled her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this house is not known. We are safe here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul glanced again towards the east. He had the
look of the hunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a man drawing nearer to us every minute
who will rake through Fez with a fine-tooth comb to
find out what has become of me,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An enemy?” Marguerite asked, in dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; my friend, Gerard de Montignac. He is on
Moinier’s staff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he will remain your friend,” cried Marguerite,
“even if he—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel completed the sentence for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Discovers that I deserted. Not he! Perhaps, just
because he was my friend, he would be harder than
any other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Underneath the good-fellowship, the fun, the delight
in the gaieties and ornaments of life, Gerard de
Montignac had all the hard practical logic of the French
character. Certain things are not permissible. For
those who do them there is a law, and that is the end of
the matter. And at the very head of the things that
are not permissible is the tampering with the military
oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Friendship will lead Gerard to search for me in
every corner,” said Paul. That was the danger. For
if Gerard stumbled upon the truth in his search, the
friend would turn straightway into the hunter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul followed Marguerite down the stairs, and they
talked earnestly for a long while. Then Paul arranged
his haik about his turban, slipped his djellaba of wool
over his linen caftan, and, going out, was very busy in
Fez all that day.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch18'>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<h3>Captain Laguessière’s Report</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>n</span> the twenty-first of April, three days later,
Gerard de Montignac rode into Fez at ten
o’clock of the morning behind General Moinier.
He was lodged at the Auvert Hospital and as he came
out of his room he passed in the corridor a face which
he remembered. He turned on the instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baumann!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann was that short stockish Alsatian belonging
to the Department of Native Affairs, whom Gerard
many months before had sought at the Villa Iris. He
shook Gerard’s hand with deferential warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain de Montignac! How can I serve you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of Gerard always made Baumann think of
the Bois de Bologne and brought to his nostrils a smell
of Paris. “Stylish” was Baumann’s epithet for this
slim razor-like being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tell me for a second time how it goes with
my <span class='it'>grand serieux</span>, and where he is to be found.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann was enchanted by the familiar allusion.
It made him out as an intimate of Captain de Montignac.
But he was baffled too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name would help,” he said, hesitating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Paul Ravenel, of course,” replied Gerard impatiently,
and Baumann’s face lengthened. He fidgeted
uncomfortably on his feet. Yes, Paul Ravenel, to be
sure! Captain de Montignac had been uneasy about
Paul Ravenel in Casablanca, when there was really no
occasion for uneasiness. This time, however, the case
was very different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, my Captain, I can give you no news of your
friend at all. Many officers were caught at a disadvantage.
We are afraid—yes, we are all very much
afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard, with his legs apart and his hands thrust into
the pockets of his riding-breeches, looked at his twittering
companion for a moment. Then he said abruptly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me hear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann had an uncomfortable little story to tell.
Late on the night of the sixteenth, the night before the
massacres openly began, Captain Ravenel had ridden
up to the door of the hospital with a native servant
carrying a lantern in front of him. He was labouring
under a great anxiety and distress. Baumann himself
received Captain Ravenel and heard his story. Captain
Ravenel had assured him that the Askris would revolt
immediately, and that there would be a massacre
of the white people throughout the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you didn’t believe Paul Ravenel?” thundered
Gerard de Montignac. Baumann was in a haste to
exculpate himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I waked up the two Intelligence Officers, Colonel
Renaud and Captain Brouarre,” he said. “They came
down in their pyjamas. We went into the room on
the right of the entrance here, and the Captain told us
all again many bad things which have since been fulfilled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you wouldn’t believe Paul Ravenel!” Gerard
looked at Baumann with a bitter amazement. “He
gave you the warning, he, the wise one, and you
thought he was exaggerating like some panic-stricken
rich Fasi.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We hoped he was exaggerating,” said the unhappy
Baumann. “You see, our hands were tied. Reports
that disturbances were likely had gone to the Embassy
before and had been not very civilly received. It was
an order that no similar reports should be presented.
It was late at night. We could do nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard could read into the halting sentences all that
Baumann was not the man to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he asked, curtly. “What of Paul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul, very disappointed, had mounted his horse
again and ridden off to the Bab Segma on his way to
the camp at Dar-Debibagh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he never reached the camp. He has not been
seen since. We are all very much afraid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was quite clear that Baumann had no hope at all
that Paul Ravenel would ever be seen again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most of our people scattered through Fez have
been accounted for,” he added. “Many were rescued
and brought here to safety. The bodies of others, too,
but not of all. There has been no means of making
enquiries.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That of course I understand,” said Gerard de Montignac,
as he turned sorrowfully away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard was a monarchist. Some day the French
would have a king again, when there was a claimant
worth his salt. Meanwhile he was heart and soul for
France, whatever its régime. So his first grief now
was for the loss to France of the great soldier that was
surely to be—nay, that was already beginning to be.
He had lost a good comrade and friend too. These
losses must be paid for—as soon as there was leisure
to exact payment—and paid for in full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile he went about his work. On the twenty-second
the troops occupied the city. The two following
days were taken up in the disarmament of the population.
Yet other two days were given to pleadings and
arguments and exhortations to Paris and the Civil Authorities
for permission to declare a state of siege.
Only when this permission was reluctantly granted and
the order made, could any of the General’s staff unbutton
their tunics and give a little time to their own affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard’s first move was to ride out to the camp at
Dar-Debibagh, whither Paul’s battalion of tirailleurs
had now returned. There he found the little Praslin
now in command of Paul’s company, and the little
Praslin had information of importance to give to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Ravenel rode back with me to the camp
from the Sultan’s Palace on the evening of the sixteenth,
after the great storm,” said Praslin. “He was
very glad that the storm had delayed for three days the
departure of the Mission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knew already, then, that afternoon, that the
massacres were coming!” said Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! I should say not. He was quite frank about
the whole position of affairs here, as he saw it. If he
had imagined that Fez itself was going to rise he would
have said so, I am sure. What he did believe was that
a serious attack would be made upon the Mission out
in the bled, on its way to the coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was afraid that the escort was not strong
enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He certainly thought that,” replied Praslin, slowly,
and in a voice which suggested that he did not consider
this explanation at all adequate to explain Paul’s satisfaction
at the postponement of the march. “But fear
doesn’t enter into the matter at all. There was something
more. I got the impression that he just hated
the idea of going down to the coast if only for a few
weeks. He wanted to stay on here in Fez. An attack
on the line of march! That he would have considered
as in the day’s work. No. He didn’t want to leave
Fez. Curious! Wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard glanced sharply at Lieutenant Praslin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho!” he exclaimed, softly. “Curious? Yes!
But then Paul Ravenel was never like the rest of
us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He remained silent for a little while, turning some
quite new thought over and over uneasily in his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” he said, waking up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After we had returned here, he changed into a dry
uniform, for we were both wet through, and told me
that he was going to dine with a friend in Fez,” Praslin
resumed. “I reminded him that there was a battalion
parade at six the next morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He answered that he had not forgotten and rode
off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that was the last you heard of him?” asked
Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the last I saw of him,” Praslin corrected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” asked Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five minutes after Captain Ravenel had gone, a
native came to the camp and asked for him. He carried
a letter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard’s face lit up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A letter? What became of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was taken by Captain Ravenel’s orderly and
placed on the table in his tent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next morning I saw it there and took charge
of it. It was addressed in Arabic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have got it still?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard reminded the little Praslin of some lean
sharp-nosed pointer which somewhere in the stubble
has picked up a scent. Praslin led him to his tent, unlocked
a leather satchel and tipped out a number of letters
on to his bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He handed a paper, not an envelope, folded and
sealed and superscribed in Arabic characters, to Gerard.
Gerard almost snatched at it. But once he had it in
his hands, he was no longer so sure. He twiddled it
between his fingers and gingerly. He sat down in
Praslin’s camp chair and looked at Praslin and looked
at the letter. He seemed to be afraid of what he might
read in it. Finally, in a burst, he cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall open it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course,” said the little Praslin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard broke the seal and read. Praslin wondered
what he had dreaded to find written upon that paper,
so evident was his relief now. It was the letter from
Si El Hadj Arrifa which had just missed Paul Ravenel
on the night of the sixteenth. It began with the
usual flowery protestations and ended with an apologetic
request that Paul should not come into Fez that
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This makes everything easier,” said Gerard, springing
up from his chair. “I shall keep this letter, Praslin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned with it in his pocket and at once made
inquiries as to what was known of Si El Hadj Arrifa.
The warning on the face of it was a sign of goodwill
to France. Yes, but some of these Fasi were very foxy
people. This letter arriving at the camp just too late to
save Paul Ravenel’s life, but in heaps of time to establish
Si El Hadj Arrifa’s good name for loyalty, might
easily have been despatched with those two objects. It
was all quite in keeping with the sly furtive character
of the men of Fez. However, Gerard was soon satisfied
on that point. Si El Hadj Arrifa was of the real
friends. Gerard accordingly knocked upon his door
that very night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was received with much ceremony and a great
warmth of welcome; not to be wondered at, since the
Moor had been sitting cowering behind his stoutly-barred
door ever since the night of the sixteenth. Gerard
made haste to put the timid man at his ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the weapons have been collected. All the gates
are held by armed posts. A state of siege is proclaimed
so that violence can be dealt with sternly and at once,”
he said. But even then he must not put the questions
burning on his tongue. France was to remain in
Morocco. Very well! Then even in small things must
the ways of the country be respected. Gerard had the
patience which is the kernel and centre of good manners.
He sat through the five brewings of green tea,
ceremoniously conversing. Only then did he come to
the reason of his visit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been my good fortune, O, Si El Hadj Arrifa,
to bring you excellent news to-night. Would that I
could hear news as excellent from you! My friend
and your friend, Captain Ravenel, dined with you one
night and rode away from your door, and that night
he disappeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si El Hadj Arrifa struck a bell which stood by his
side and spoke a word to the negress who answered it.
He turned again to Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sent for my servant Mohammed, who carried
the lantern in front of His Excellency’s horse.
He shall tell you the story with his own lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohammed duly appeared and told the truth—with
omissions; how the Captain had fallen behind in the
tunnel, how the startled horse had dashed past him,
how he had returned and found no sign of the Captain
at all, how two men had appeared and he had fled in a
panic. But there was no mention of any small door
in the angle of the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will look at that tunnel by daylight,” said Gerard,
when the man had finished, “if, O, Si El Hadj Arrifa,
you will lend me your servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke dispiritedly. There seemed very little
chance that he would find any trace of his <span class='it'>grand
serieux</span>. He had been and he was not. No doubt these
two men at the mouth of the tunnel had seen their
opportunity and seized it. Paul Ravenel had been the
first victim of the massacre, no doubt. Yet Paul—to
be taken unawares—with Si El Hadj Arrifa’s earnest
invitation to remain sheltered in his house only within
this hour uttered—Paul, in a word, warned! That
was not like the Paul Ravenel he knew, at all! And on
the next morning, following Paul’s route with Mohammed
for a guide, and a patrol of soldiers, he discovered
the little door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a thrill of excitement he ran his hands over
the heavy nails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open! Open!” he cried, beating upon the panel
with his fists; and pressing his ear against it afterwards,
he heard the racket echo emptily through the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open! Open!” he cried again, and, turning to
the sergeant of the patrol, bade him find a heavy beam.
Even with that used as a battering ram it took the
patrol a good half hour to smash in the little door, so
stout it was, so strong the bolts and bars. But the
work was done at last. Gerard darted in and found
himself in a house, small but exquisite in its decorations,
its thick cushions of linen worked with the old
silk embroideries of Fez, its white-tiled floors spread
with carpets of the old Rabat patterns. But from roof
to court the house was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard went through every room with the keen eye
of a possible tenant with an order to view; and found
precisely nothing. Had he come a week ago, he would
have discovered on the upper floors furniture of a completely
European make. All that, however, was safely
lodged now in a storehouse belonging to Si El Hadj
Arrifa, and the upper floors were almost bare. Gerard
had left the patio to the last, and whilst he stepped
here and there he heard a tinkling sound very familiar
to his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that?” he cried, swinging round.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a corner of an alcove the sergeant was bending
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that, Beauprè?” Gerard cried again, and
the sergeant stood up and faced him. He was holding
in his hands the blue tunic of an officer; and on the
breast of it a row of the big French medals tinkled and
glinted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard took the tunic reverently from the sergeant’s
hands. It was all cluttered with blood, and stabbed
through and through. It had the badges of Paul’s
rank, and still discernible on a linen label inside the
collar was Paul’s name. It was here, then, in this house,
that Paul Ravenel had been done to death. The tunic
which Gerard held in his hand was the conclusive
proof. He stood in the centre of the patio, so pleasant,
so quiet now, with the shafts of bright sunlight breaking
upon the tiles. Who had lived here? What dreadful
scene had been staged in this empty house? Gerard
shivered a little as he thought upon it. The knives at
their slow work—the man, his friend, slowly losing,
whilst the heart still beat and the nerves stabbed, all
the semblance of a man!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they shall pay,” he said aloud, in a bellowing
voice; and while he shouted, a perplexity began to
trouble him. He opened the door leading from the
court into the outer passage. This passage was cumbered
with the splintered panels, the bolts, the heavy
transverse bars which the patrol’s battering ram had demolished.
How was it that in this empty house the
door was still barricaded from within? He returned
into the court and saw that the sergeant had pushed
aside a screen at the back, and in a recess had discovered
a second door. This door was merely locked,
and there was no key in the lock. It was quickly
opened. The Karouein river raced and foamed amidst
its boulders, and between the river and the house wall
there ran a tiny path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard crossed to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that way they went. When, I wonder? Perhaps
when we were actually beating on the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unpinned the medals from his friend’s blood-stained
tunic and wrapped them up in a handkerchief.
There might be somewhere a woman who would love
to keep them bright. Paul Ravenel talked little
about his own affairs. Who could tell? If there were
no one, he could treasure them himself in memory of
a good comrade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile there was an immediate step to take. A
crowd had gathered in the gateway and about the door
in the dark tunnel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose is this house?” Gerard asked, and there
were many voices raised at once with the answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Ahmed Driss of Ouezzan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was taken aback by the answer.
Si Ahmed Driss was one of the great Shereefian
family of Ouezzan, which exercised an authority and
a power quite independent of the Sultan. From the
first, moreover, it had been unswervingly loyal to the
French. Si Ahmed Driss himself during the days of
massacre had given shelter in the sanctuary of his own
residence to all the Europeans whom he could reach.
Gerard de Montignac went straight now to where he
lived in the Tala and begged an audience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have broken into a house which I now learn belongs
to you, Si Ahmed Driss, whom may God preserve,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Ahmed Driss was a tall, dignified old gentleman
with a white beard flowing over his chest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is forgiven,” he said, gently. “In these days
many strange things are done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet this was not done without reason,” Gerard protested,
and he told Si Ahmed Driss of the finding of
the tunic and the story of Mohammed the servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Ahmed Driss bowed his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That this should have happened in my house puts
me to shame,” he said. “I let it many months ago to
Ben Sedira—a man of Meknes whom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and a flow
of wondrous curses was invoked upon Ben Sedira himself
and his ancestors and descendants to the remotest
degrees of consanguinity, by the patriarch. A bargee,
could he but have understood, would have listened to
them in awe and withdrawn from competition. The
old gentleman, however, in uttering them lost none of
his dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ben Sedira of Meknes,” Gerard repeated. “We
will see if we can find that man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had very little hope of succeeding. There
had been two clear days between the end of the revolt
and the arrival of Moinier’s column, during which
surveillance could not be exercised. There were not
sufficient French soldiers to hold the town gates and
question all who went in and out. The moment the
French tricolours floated so gaily upon all the house-tops
of Fez, Ben Sedira would have known the game
was up. He would have gone and gone quickly; nor
would Meknes in the future house any one of his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Gerard de Montignac reasoned, the affair
would remain a mystery. Official enquiries would be
made. But the great wheels of Administration could
not halt for ever at the little door in the roofed alley.
Paul Ravenel would become a case, one of the infinite
enigmas of Mohammedan Africa. So he thought during
the next fortnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Gerard was on General Moinier’s staff, and
many reports came under his eyes. Amongst them, one
written by a Captain Laguessière, giving an account of
an unsuccessful attempt to relieve a little post at the
Bab Fetouh on the afternoon of the seventeenth, the
second day of the revolt. Gerard was reading the report
in his office not overcarefully when a passage leaped out
on the written page and startled him. He sat for a
moment very still. Then he shook or tried to shake
some troublesome thought from his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It couldn’t be, of course!” he said, but he read the
passage again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here is what he read:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met with no trouble until I had passed the lime-kilns
and crossed a bridge over the Oued el Kebir.
Here further progress was stopped by three strong
groups of Moors armed with rifles. It was clear to me
that I could not force a way through with my twenty
men and retain any hope of relieving the post. I determined,
therefore, to make a detour and try to advance
by way of the Bab Jedid. As I recrossed the
bridge I was violently attacked from the rear, from in
front of me and from a street upon my left; whilst
from a house upon my right I saw a number of the
Askris pour out. I ordered a charge, and, leading ‘<span class='it'>au
pas gymnastique</span>,’ I brought my men into a narrow
turning, whence we were able to clear the street by repeated
volleys. I had two men killed and six wounded.
I received great assistance from a tall Moor who, jumping
from the crowd, charged with my men. He was
armed only with a big heavy pole, but he swung it about
him with so much vigour and skill that he cleared a
space for us. I tried to find this Moor when I had
re-formed my men, but he had disappeared as suddenly
as he had come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac sat back in his chair and ran
his fingers through his sleek hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, it’s quite out of the question,” he assured
himself. But none the less he rose abruptly and,
leaving the report on his desk, went into another office
inconveniently crowded. At the far end of the room
was seated at a desk the man for whom he was looking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baumann!” he called. “Can you spare me a minute?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann rose and followed Gerard back to his
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a chair there.” He pointed to one at the side
of his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you remember telling me some time ago at
Casablanca that you once met Captain Ravenel close
to Volubilis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Baumann. “I didn’t recognise him.
He twirled a great staff round his head and frightened
me out of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s it,” said Gerard. “A little thing in one
of these reports reminded me of your story. I wanted
to be sure of it. Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann rose to go and stopped with his hand upon
the door-knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great loss, Captain Ravenel. There is no news
of him, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it known whom he dined with that last night he
was seen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Si El Hadj Arrifa.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si El Hadj Arrifa was one of Captain Ravenel’s
closest friends in Fez. But there’s another closer still
of whom you might enquire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will. Give me his name,” said Gerard eagerly,
and he drew a slip of paper towards him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not write upon it. For Baumann answered:
“Si Ahmed Driss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard dropped his pencil and looked swiftly up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of the Sheereefs of Ouezzan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard set his elbows on the arms of his chair and
joined his hands under his chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Paul was a great friend of Si Ahmed Driss, was
he?” he said ever so softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It was as a servant in the train of Si Ahmed
Driss of Ouezzan that Captain Ravenel travelled
through the Zarhoun country, and visited the Holy
Cities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. Thank you, Baumann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac was swimming in deep waters.
He was not imaginative but he had imagination.
He comprehended, though he did not feel, the call and
glamour of the East; and nowhere in the world is there
a land more vividly Eastern in its spirit, its walled cities,
its nomad tribes, and its wide spaces, than this
northwestern corner of Africa. Gerard had lived long
enough in it to see men yield to it, as to a drug, forsake
for it all that is lovely and of good repute. Was
this what had happened to his friend? He wondered
sorrowfully. Paul was friendly, cheerful, gay, but
none the less really and truly a man of terrific loneliness.
Walled about always. Gerard tried to think
of an intimate confidence which Paul had ever made
him. He could not remember one. He was the very
man to whom the strange roads might call with the
voices of the Sirens. It might be .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it might be.
Gerard de Montignac never sought again for traces of
his lost friend. He left the search to the Administration
and the Administration had other work to do.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h3>In the Sacred City</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> sharp lesson, then the goodwill; and always
even during the infliction of the lesson,
fair dealing between man and man, and nothing
taken without payment on the spot. This, the traditional
policy of the great French Governors, was carried
out in Fez. Only the lesson was not so sharp as many
thought it should have been. But the policy achieved
its end, and it was not long before many a Fasi, like
his kinsmen of the Chaiouïa, would proudly assure you
that he was a Frenchman. The work of settlement and
order could be transferred to other regions, and Gerard
de Montignac went with it. He served in the
mountains about Taza during the autumn of that year,
and then went upon long leave. He was in Paris for
Christmas, and there, amidst its almost forgotten lights
and brilliancies, took his pleasures like a boy. He
hunted in the Landes, returned to Morocco, and a year
later, after a campaign in the country south of Marrakesch,
got his step and the command of his battalion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For three months afterwards he was stationed at
Meknes and drew his breath. He had the routine of
his work to occupy his mornings, and in this city of
wide spaces and orchards to engross his afternoons.
Meknes with the ruined magnificence of its palaces of
dead kings, its huge crumbling stables, the great gate
of mosaic built through so many years by so many
captives of the Sallee pirates, and so many English
prisoners from Tangier; that other gate hardly less
beautiful to the north of the town; its groves of olives;
its long crumbling crenellated walls reaching out for
miles into the country with no reason, and with no
reason abruptly ending—Meknes satisfied the æsthetic
side of him as no other city in that enchanted country.
He delighted in it as a woman in her jewels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in the autumn the Zarhoun threatened trouble
for the hundredth time—the Zarhoun, that savage
mountain mass with its sacred cities which frowns
above the track from Meknes to Rabat and through
which the narrow path from Tangier to Fez is cleft.
It was decided that the sacred cities must at last throw
open their gates and the Zarhoun be brought into line.
The work was entrusted to Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have a mixed battalion of infantry, a
squadron of Chasseurs, a section of mitrailleuses, and
a couple of mountain guns,” said the Commander-in-Chief.
“But I think you will not need to use them.
It will be a demonstration, a reconnaissance in force,
rather than an attack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus one morning of June, Gerard led his force
northwards over the rolling plain, onto the higher
ground, and marching along the flank of Djebel Zarhoun,
camped that night close to the tall columns and
broken arches of Volubilis. In front of the camp, a
mile away, dark woods of olive trees mounted the
lower slopes, and above them the sacred city of Mulai
Idris clung to the mountain sides, dazzlingly white
against the sombre hill and narrowing as it rose to an
apex of one solitary house. In the failing light it had
the appearance of a gigantic torrent, which, forcing itself
through a tiny cleft, spread fanwise as it fell, in a
cascade of foam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no fighting, as the Commander-in-Chief
had predicted. At nine o’clock the next morning the
Basha, followed by three of his notable men, rode down
on their mules through the olive groves, and, being led
to the little tent over which floated the little red flag of
the commander, made his obeisance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go back with your Excellency into the city,”
said Gerard, and he gave orders that a company of
tirailleurs should escort him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, then, an hour later they set out: Gerard riding
ahead with the Basha upon his right, the notables behind,
and behind them again the company of tirailleurs
advancing in column of platoons with one Captain
Laguessière at their head. When they reached the first
of the rising ground, Gerard reined in his horse and
stared about him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha, a portly man with a black beard, smiled
with a flash of white teeth and the air of one expecting
compliments. He did not get them, however. Gerard’s
face wore, indeed, a quite unfriendly look. He
turned round in his saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Laguessière.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laguessière, who had halted his company, rode up
to Gerard’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my Commandant. I have been wondering for
the last few minutes whether it was possible. If these
fellows had put up a fight we might have lost a lot
of men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Gerard, shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the right and left of the track which led up to
the gate of the town, very well placed, just on the first
rise of the ground, were fire trenches. Not roughly
scooped shallow depressions, but real trenches scientifically
constructed. Deep and recessed and with
traverses at short intervals. The inside walls were
revetted; arm rests had been cut for the riflemen, the
earth dug from the trenches had been used for parapets
and these had been turfed over for concealment;
there were loopholes, artfully hidden by bunches of
grass or little bundles of branches and leaves. Communication
trenches ran back and—nothing so struck
Gerard de Montignac with surprise as this—the extra
earth had been built into parapets for dummy trenches,
so that the fire of the attacking force might be diverted
from those which were manned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The surprise of the two officers caused the
Moors the greatest satisfaction. The three notables
were wreathed in smiles. The Basha laughed outright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are good,” he said, nodding his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too good,” replied Gerard, gravely. “But it is as
well that you did not use them against us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the Moors this rejoinder seemed the very cream
of wit. The Basha rocked in his saddle at the mere
idea that his trenches could have been designed against
the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed! We are true friends of your Excellency
and your people. We know that you are just
and very powerful too. These trenches were intended
to defend our sacred city from the Zemmour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the Zemmour! Of course,” exclaimed Gerard,
openly scoffing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Zemmour were turbulent and aggressive and
marauders to a man. They lived in the Forest of
Mamora and sallied out of it far afield. But they were
also the bogey men of the countryside. You threatened
your squalling baby with the Zemmour, and whatever
bad thing you had done, you had done it in terror
of the Zemmour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha was undisturbed by Gerard de Montignac’s
incredulity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the Zemmour are very wicked people,” he said,
smiling virtuously and apparently quite unconscious
that he himself presided over a city of malefactors and
cutthroats. “But now that you have taken us poor
people under your protection we feel safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard smiled grimly and Captain Laguessière
stroked his fair moustache and remarked: “He has a
fine nerve, this old bandit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when did you expect the Zemmour?” asked
Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two weeks, three weeks ago. They sent word
that they would attack us on a certain night, so that
we might be ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then they didn’t come?” said Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Laguessière laughed, incredulous of the
whole story. But Gerard recognised a simple form of
humour thoroughly Moroccan. To warn your enemy
that you meant to attack him, to keep him on the watch
and thoroughly alarmed all night and then never to attack
him at all—that might well seem to the Zemmour
a most diverting stroke of wit. The Zemmour, after
all, were not so very far from Zarhoun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” said Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t, my Commandant,” replied Captain Laguessière.
“I think that if they hadn’t seen our mountain
guns passing up the track below, we should have found
these trenches manned this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard turned about on his horse and looked down
onto the plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. They could see very clearly. That’s the explanation—so
far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave his attention once more to the construction
of the trenches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who taught you to make those trenches, my
friend?” Gerard asked, looking keenly at the Basha.
The Basha answered composedly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Allah who put it into our heads. Allah
protecting the holy city where Mulai Idris lies
buried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very fine,” Captain Laguessière observed.
“But then who lent Allah his copy of the
Manual of Field Engineering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly,” Gerard agreed with a laugh. “I think we
had better find that out. No Moor that ever I met
with would take the time and trouble, even if he had
the skill, to work out——” and the laugh died off his
lips. He turned suddenly startled eyes upon his companion.
“Laguessière!” he exclaimed, and again, in
a lower key, “Yes, Laguessière! I was sure that I had
never met you before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not until this expedition, my Commandant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet your name was familiar to me. I did not
think why. I was too busy to think why. But I remember
now. You were in Fez two years ago. Yes,
I remember now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His face darkened and hardened and grew very
menacing as he sat with moody eyes fixed upon the
ground and seeing visions of old and pleasant days
leap into life and fade. “Volubilis, too!” he said in
a low voice. “Yes, just below those olives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange that he should have seen the columns and
broken arches yesterday and again this morning, and
only thought of them with wonder as the far-flung
monuments of the old untiring Rome! And never
until this moment as things of great and immediate
concern to him—signs perhaps for him to read and
not neglect. For of all the pictures which he saw
changing and flickering upon the ground, two came
again and again. He saw Baumann and his friends
riding in the springtime between clumps of asphodel
towards those high pillars, and a horde of wild ragged
men pouring out of the gates of this white-walled city,
and Baumann shrinking back as a tall youth whirled
with a grin a great staff about his head. Then he saw
the same man, whirling the same staff, charge with
Laguessière’s section in a street of Fez. A grim and
sinister fancy flashed into his mind. He wondered
whether he had been appointed by destiny to demand
here and to-day an account for the betrayal of a great
and sacred trust. He looked up the hill to where the
big wooden gates stood open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the only entrance into Mulai Idris?” he
asked of the Basha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac turned to his subordinate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will set a guard upon that gate, Captain Laguessière.
No one is to go out until I give a further
order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, my Commandant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will have the town patrolled and the walls
watched. I will bring up another company to act with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wrote an order with a pencil in his note book,
detached the leaf, and sent it back by an orderly to the
camp. “Now we will move on,” he said. All his good
humour had vanished. He had no longer any jests to
exchange with the Basha as the little cavalcade rode
upwards among the olive trees and through the steep,
narrow streets of the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an open space just below that last big house which
made the apex of the triangle, a seat was placed, and
to this Gerard de Montignac was conducted. The little
city lay spread out in a fan beneath him. The great
Mosque in which the tomb of the Founder of the Moorish
Empire was sheltered stood at the southern angle.
Gerard looked down into a corner of its open precincts
and saw men walking to and fro. He called the Basha
to his side, and pointed down to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that is the great Mosque, your Excellency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one will violate it. For us it is sacred as for
you,” said Gerard. “But no food must go into it.
That is a strict order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be obeyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall place men of my own in the streets about
the entrances. They will molest no one, but they will
see to it that the order is obeyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Mosque was sanctuary, of course. Any man
who took refuge there was safe. Neither the law nor
any vengeance could touch him. But no man must die
in it, for that would be a defilement. A little time,
therefore, and any refugee would be thrust out by the
guardians of the sanctuary, lest his death should taint
the holy place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard sent a messenger down with a new order to
Laguessière at the gate and waited on the seat until it
had been carried out, and Laguessière had ridden to his
side. The two officers lunched with the Basha and his
notables in the big house and drank the five cups of tea
with them afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will now ride with you through the town,” said
Gerard to the Basha. “You shall tell me of the houses
and of those who live in them. And you shall take me
into those I wish, so that I may speak to them and
assure them of our friendship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be an excellent thing,” replied the Basha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard kept a sergeant and a small guard of soldiers
with him, and with the Basha on his mule beside him
he rode down on the left side of the town. For on
this side only, he had seen, were there any houses of
importance. The rest of the town was made up of
hovels and little cottages. The three chief men who
rode with the Basha pointed out their own residences
with pride; the owners of others were described, and
at each of them Gerard smiled and said he was
content. They made thus a complete circuit of the
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Excellency has not thought fit to enter any
one of the houses,” said the Basha with a smile of
reproach. Gerard led him a little apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will make good that omission now,” he replied.
“There was one which we passed. You did not speak
of it at all. Yet it was a good house, a fine house,
finer almost than any except your Excellency’s own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha was apparently mystified. He could not
remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think that I can find the house again,” said
Gerard. “I hope that I shall be able to. For it attracted
me.” He looked the Basha in the eyes. “That
is the house which I wish to enter and whose owner
I wish to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finality was in Gerard’s voice as clearly as in his
words. The Basha bowed to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for your Excellency to give orders here. We
are in God’s hands,” he said, and he drew a step nearer
to Gerard de Montignac. “It is permitted to dismiss
my friends now to their homes? Si Tayeb Reha,
whom we shall visit, will not be prepared for so many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Tayeb Reha?” Gerard repeated. “That is his
name? I had a thought it might be Ben Sedira.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is not a name known in Mulai Idris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to his notables and took leave of them
with ceremonious speeches. Then he mounted his mule
again and rode down the hill beside Gerard with the
sergeant and the escort at their heels. Gerard said not
a word now. He was thinking of those carefully constructed
trenches outside the city, and his face grew
hard as granite. They came to a house of two storeys
with one latticed window in the uppermost floor, and
for the rest a blank wall upon the street. It was for
Fez a small house, for Mulai Idris one of importance.
The door opened upon a side street, and the sergeant
knocked upon it whilst Gerard and the Basha dismounted.
There followed a long silence whilst a little
crowd gathered about the soldiers. Gerard wondered
what message that sharp loud knocking brought to
the inmate. Had he seen the cavalcade ride past from
a corner of that latticed window and with a smile upon
his lips believed himself to be safe? What a shattering
blow, then, must have been this sudden knocking
upon his door? Or was he himself altogether in error?
Gerard drew a breath of relief at the mere hope that
it might be so. Well, he would know now, for the
door was opened. And in a moment all Gerard’s hopes
fell. For the native who opened it was surprised into
a swift movement as his eyes fell upon Gerard in his
uniform. It was a movement which he checked before
he had completed it, but he was too late. He had betrayed
himself. It was the involuntary movement of
an old soldier standing to attention at the sudden appearance
of an officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha spoke a few words to the servant who
stood inside. There was no court in this house. A
staircase faced them steeply, and on the right hand of
it was the kitchen. Gerard turned to the servant as he
passed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Selim,” answered the servant. He led the way up
the dark staircase. There was no window upon
the staircase; the only light came from the doorway
upon the street. At the top there was a landing
furnished with comfort, and in the middle of the landing
was a fine door. Selim knocked upon it, and would
have opened it. But Gerard laid his hand upon his
arm and with a gesture in place of words bade him
stand aside. He opened the door himself and entered.
He was standing in a room of low roof but wide. It
was furnished altogether in the Moorish style, and
with a certain elegance. But the elegance was rather in
the disposition of the room than in the quality of its
equipment. One great window, with a balcony protected
by a rail, gave light to the room; and it looked
not upon the street but across a great chasm to the
mountain, for the house was built upon the town
wall. The light thus flooded the room. Close to the
window a tall Moor was standing. He bowed and took
a step forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had I hoped that your Excellency would do me
the honour to visit my poor house,” he said with a
smile, “I should have made a better preparation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had a small beard trimmed neatly to a point and
a thin line of moustache. Gerard did not answer him
for a little while. He took out his note book and wrote
in it and detached the leaf. Then he sent Selim down
the stairs to fetch up the sergeant of his escort; and it
was noticeable that, scrupulous as he usually was in
this land of observances, he made use of the servant
as his messenger without troubling himself to ask the
master’s permission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the sergeant came up into the room, Gerard
handed him the sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will send this by one of your men immediately
to Captain Laguessière at the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, my Commandant,” and the sergeant
went out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard turned to the Basha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have sent an order to remove the posts from the
neighbourhood of the Mosque, and to throw open the
gates so that men may go out and in as they will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha expressed his thanks. There would be no
trouble. The people of Mulai Idris were very good
people, not like those scoundrels from the Forest of
Mamora, and quite devoted to the French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since this morning,” Gerard answered with a smile.
“We shall have much to say to one another to-morrow
morning, in a spirit of help and goodwill. But I beg
you to leave me now, so that I may talk for a little while
privately with Si Tayeb Reha. For I have come now
to the end of this day’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Tayeb Reha bowed gravely. It was the only
movement he had made since he had spoken his words
of welcome upon Gerard’s first entrance into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Basha took his leave, went downstairs and
mounted his mule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all in God’s hands,” he said, and he rode
slowly away towards his house. Within the room the
two men stood looking at each other in silence.</p>

<h3>The Coup de Grâce</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> longer the silence grew, the more difficult
Gerard de Montignac felt it was to break. He
had entered the room, clothed upon with authority,
sensible of it and prepared to demand explanations
and exact retribution. But he had now a curious
uneasiness. His authority seemed to be slipping from
him. Opposite to him without a movement of his
body and his face still as a mask, stood <span class='it'>le grand
serieux</span>, as half in jest, half in earnest, he used to
label Paul Ravenel. He had not a doubt of his identity.
But <span class='it'>le grand serieux</span> was altogether in earnest
<span class='it'>le grand serieux</span> at this moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quiet, tragic figure, drawn to his full height, wearing
his dignity with the ease of an accustomed garment,
when he should be—what? Crushed under
shame, faltering excuses, cringing! Gerard de Montignac
said to himself: “Why, I might be the culprit!
It might be for me to offer an explanation, or to
try to.” He almost wondered if he was the culprit,
so complete was his discomfort, and so utterly he felt
himself at a disadvantage. He whipped himself to a
sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid that I am not very welcome, Si Tayeb
Reha,” he said, speaking in French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Si Tayeb Reha! Yes! That is my name,” returned
the Moor, in the Mohgrebbin dialect of Arabic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alias Ben Sedira of Meknes. Alias Paul Ravenel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Moor frowned in perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alias,” he repeated, doubtfully, “and Pôl Rav——”
He gave the name up. “What are these words? If
your Excellency would speak my language——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your language!” Gerard interrupted, roughly.
“Since when have the outcasts a language of their
own?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung himself into a chair. He was not going to
take a part in any comedy. He continued to speak in
French. “You thought you were safe enough here, no
doubt. Oh, it was a clever plan, I grant you. Who
would look for Paul Ravenel in the sacred city of
Mulai Idris? Yet not so safe, after all, if any one
knew that you had once travelled through the Zahoun
in the train of Si Ahmed Driss of Ouezzan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaned forward suddenly as some prosecuting
counsél in a criminal court might do, seeking to terrify
a defendant into an expression or a movement of guilt.
But Si Tayeb Reha was simply worried because he
could not understand a word of all the scorn which
was tumbling from Gerard’s mouth. The officer was
angry—that was only too evident—and with him, Si
Tayeb Reha! If only he could make it all out! Gerard
grew more exasperated than ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not safe at all if any one had seen you come
out of these gates in the rabble to drive away a visitor
to Volubilis. Baumann, eh? Do you remember Baumann
of the Affaires Indigènes, Paul Ravenel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Tayeb Reha raised his hands:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Excellency speaks in a tongue I do not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You understand very well. Sanctuary, eh? If one
guessed you had run to earth here—sanctuary! No
one dare violate the sacred city of Mulai Idris. Once
sheltered within its walls, safe to lead the dreadful
squalid life you’ve chosen right to its last mean day!
Your mistake, Paul Ravenel! The arm of France is
stretched over all this country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard stopped abruptly and flung himself back in
his chair in disgust. He was becoming magniloquent
now. In a minute he would be ridiculous, and over
against him all the while stood this renegade, dwarfing
him by his very silence, and the stillness of his body,
putting him in the wrong—for that was it! Putting
him in the wrong who was in the right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard had imagination. He was hampered now
by that accursed gift of the artist. Even whilst he
spoke he was standing outside himself and watching
himself speak, and act, and watching with eyes hostilely
critical. Thus were things well interpreted, but
not thus were they well done. Thus they were made
brilliantly to live again; but not thus were they so
contrived as to be worthy to live again. Since by that
road come hesitations and phrases that miss their mark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to sting Si Tayeb Reha into a rejoinder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trenches, too! Fire-trenches on the latest plan—so
that if by chance we should come and be fools
enough to come without guns”—he broke off and beat
upon the table with his closed fist—“you would fight
France, would you, to keep your burrow secret! The
insolence of it! The Zemmour indeed! Fire-trenches
and traverses and the rest of it against the Zemmour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Tayeb Reha leapt upon a word familiar to his
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Zemmour! Yes,” he cried, smiling his relief.
Here was something which he could understand. “The
Zemmour threatened us two, three, four weeks ago.
We made ready to welcome them. But they did not
come. They were very wise, the Zemmour!” and he
chuckled and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard found this man of smiles and cunning easier
to talk with than the aloof masked figure of a minute
ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was you who constructed those trenches and
against us, who were once your comrades,” he said
sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Si Tayeb Reha was once more at a loss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your Excellency will not speak my tongue, how
shall I answer you?” he asked, plaintively, and Gerard
did not trouble to answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to send you down to Meknes, for a court-martial
to deal with you,” he said, reflectively. “But
all strange crimes have their lures. They breed. God
knows what decent-living youngster might get his imagination
unwholesomely stirred and do as you have
done and bring his name to disgrace! Besides—do
you know who guards the gate of Mulai Idris whilst I
talk to you? Who but Laguessière? Captain Laguessière.”
He searched the still face for a tremor, a
twitch of recognition. Si Tayeb Reha had apparently
given up the attempt to understand. He stood leaning
against the wall at the side of the window and looking
out across the ravine to the mountainside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laguessière, at whose side you charged twisting
your staff—do you remember?—back over the bridge
by the lime-kilns in Fez two years ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light fell full upon the face of the man at the
window. It seemed to Gerard de Montignac impossible
that any man, even the <span class='it'>grand serieux</span>, who had
so often carried his life in his hands through the solitary
places, could have learnt so to school his features
and keep all meaning from his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that charge counts for you, and something else
which shouldn’t count at all. You and I were at St.
Cyr together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, that counted most of all. The sense of an
old comradeship broken, the traditions of a great college
violated, these had been the true cause of Gerard
de Montignac’s discomfort. The years were beginning
to build the high barriers about Gerard, shutting off
great tracts of which he had once had glimpses to
make the heart leap, taking the bright colour from his
visions. A treasure-house of good memories was
something nowadays to value, and here was one of the
good memories, almost the most vivid of them all, destroyed.
He rose from his chair, and as he rose, a
curtain moved which covered an archway, moved and
ever so slightly parted. It was just behind Si Tayeb
Reha’s shoulder, and a little to his right at the side of
the room; so that he did not notice the movement.
Gerard de Montignac could look through the narrow
opening. He had a glimpse of a woman with her face
veiled, an orange scarf about her head, a broad belt of
gold brocade about her white robe. Somehow the sight
of her helped him, though he saw her but for a second,
before the curtains closed again. It spurred him to
that statement which from the outset he had been working
to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So that’s it!” he cried. “A woman, eh? Two
years since she took your fancy! She must be getting
on now, mustn’t she? What’s her age? Seventeen?
And for that, honour, career, a decent life, all, into the
dustbin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew his heavy revolver from the pouch at his
belt and laid it on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is loaded,” he said. “You have just the time
until my sergeant notices that I have left my revolver
behind in this house. If I come back, and—no shot has
been fired—then it is Meknes with all its shame and
the same end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing surprised Gerard de Montignac more than
the coolness with which Si Tayeb Reha, as his old comrade
called himself, received his sentence of death. He
advanced to the table where the revolver lay and took
the weapon up with a smile of curiosity and admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We make no such weapons as these,” he said in
Arabic, examining the pistol with all a Moor’s fascination
for mechanical instruments. “That, your Excellency,
is why we are never a match for you and we
must open our gates at your summons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never said one word except in Arabic during
the whole of that interview, just as Gerard had stubbornly
refused to speak anything but French. Gerard
watched him toying with the weapon for a second and
then turned rapidly away. He could not but admire
his old friend’s courage; he could not but think: “What
a waste of a good man!” He went out of the room
without another word or another look. He was sick
at heart. He no longer cared whether he had been
peevish or argumentative or what kind of figure he had
cut. One of the glamorous things in his life, his belief
in the <span class='it'>grand serieux</span>, had been taken from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mounted his horse and rode away, wishing for
that shot to explode as quickly as possible, so that he
might bury the dreadful episode out of sight and forget
it altogether.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he listened with both his ears and though
he walked his horse as slowly as he could, he heard
nothing. He saw his sergeant suddenly look at his
belt. It was coming, then, without a doubt. The next
moment the sergeant was at his side and looking up
into his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My commandant, you have left your revolver behind
in that house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac took all the time that he could.
He stared at the sergeant and made him repeat his
statement as though he had been lost in thought and
had never heard it at all. Then he looked down at the
holster and fingered it as if he were trying to recollect
where in the world he had taken the revolver
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, that’s true,” he said, at last. He wheeled his
horse around and rode back very dispiritedly with his
chin sunk upon his breast. “It is to be Meknes after
all, then, and all the public shame,” the sergeant heard
him mutter; and then a pistol cracked sharp and clear,
and Gerard raised his face. It was lit with a great
relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were only ten paces from the house. Gerard
dismounted and gave the reins to the sergeant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait for me here! Keep the door clear!” he ordered.
He had left the door of the house open when
he rode away. It was open still. Gerard ran up the
stairs and burst into the room. There was a smell of
gunpowder in the air, and the Moorish woman with
the orange scarf and the white robe and the deep gold
waistband was standing with her hands pressed over
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no sign of Si Tayeb Reha anywhere.
They had tried to trick him, then! They imagined
that he would accept the evidence of the pistol-shot and
continue on his way! They took him for no better
than a child, it seemed. No, that would not do!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” he asked, angrily, of the girl, and
now he, too, spoke in Arabic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pointed a trembling hand towards the window;
and Gerard saw that the rail of the balustrade of the
balcony was broken and that the revolver lay upon the
boards. Gerard stepped out from the window and
looked down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The balcony had been built out from the sheer wall;
it was a rough thing of boards, supported upon iron
stanchions, and jutting out above the deep chasm at
the edge of the town. Gerard could see between the
boards deep down a precipice of rocks to a tiny white
thread of stream and clumps of bushes. He drew close
to the broken rail and leaned cautiously over. Caught
upon some outcropping rocks, a little way below the
wall, hung the body of Si Tayeb Reha. He was lying
face downwards, his arms outspread. The story of
what had happened was written there for him to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel had shot himself on the balcony, the
revolver had fallen from his hand, his body had
crashed through the flimsy rail and toppled down until
it had been caught on the rocks below. Yes, no doubt!
The mere fall from that height, even if Ravenel had
been unhurt, would have been enough. Yet—yet—there
had been a long delay before the shot was fired.
Gerard looked keenly and swiftly about the room.
No, there was no sign of a rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at the girl. She was now crouched down
upon her knees, her face hidden between her hands,
her body rocking, whilst a wail like a chant, shrill of
key but faint, made a measure for her rocking. She
was like an animal in pain—that was all, and for her
Paul had thrown a great name to the winds! What
a piece of irony that she, with hardly more brain and
soul than a favourite dog, should have cost France so
much!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard stooped and picked up his revolver. He
broke the breech, ejected the one exploded cartridge,
and closed the breech again with a snap. He leaned
forward again to take a last look at that poor rag of
flesh and bone, hung there for the vultures to feed
upon, which once had been his friend—and he was
aware of a subtle change in the woman behind him
within the room. Oh, very slight, and for so small
a space of time! But just for an imperceptible moment
her wail had faltered, the rocking of her body
had been stayed. She had been watching him between
those fingers with the henna-dyed nails which were so
tightly pressed over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her closely without moving from his
position. It was all going correctly on again—the
lament, the swaying, the proper conventional expression
of the abandonment of grief. Yet she had been
watching him, and for a moment she had been startled
and afraid. Of what? And the truth flashed upon
him. He had been fingering his revolver. She was
afraid of the <span class='it'>coup de grâce</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they were tricking him between them—she with
her wailing, he spread out on the bulge of rock below.
They should see! He stretched out his arm downwards,
the revolver pointed in his hand. And out of
the tail of his eye he saw the woman cease from her
exhibition and rise to her feet. As he took his aim
she unwound the veil from before her face. He could
not but look at her; and having looked, he could not
take his eyes from her face. He stumbled into the
room. “Marguerite Lambert!” he said, in a voice of
wonder! “Yes, Marguerite Lambert!”</p>

<h3>Two Outcasts</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>G</span>erard</span> de Montignac had never been so
thoroughly startled and surprised in his life.
But he was angrily conscious of an emotion
far keener than his surprise. He was jealous. Jealousy
overmastered the shock of wonder, stabbed him
through and left him aching. Marguerite Lambert,
the girl of the Villa Iris, so politely difficult! And
Paul Ravenel, the man without passion! Why, his
brother officers used to laugh at him openly—nay, almost
sneered at him and made a butt of him—because
of his coldness; and he, indifferent to their laughter,
had just laughed back and gone his way. Well, he
could afford to, it seemed, since he was here, and for
two years had been here, hidden quite away from the
world with Marguerite Lambert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had stolen a march upon their friends, the pair
of them, they had tricked them—yes, that was the exact
right word—tricked them, even as they had just
tried to trick him, she with her Oriental abandonment
to grief—little “animal,” as he had called her in his
thoughts—he stretched out on a knob of rock above a
precipice in a pose of death! Gerard was in an ugly
mood, and he spoke out his thought in a blaze of scorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked you the last time I saw you to give me two
days of your life, my only two days. I asked no more.
Yet you were insulted. You could give two years to
another, but two days to me? Oh, dear, no! You
wished never to speak to me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would give two days to no man,” Marguerite
replied, gently, “though I would give my whole life to
one man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even though he deserted?” Gerard asked, with a
sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paul had not deserted when I gave myself to him,”
she answered, quietly. “When he did, it was to save
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard did not want to hear anything about that.
Some conjecture that the truth of this catastrophe was
to be discovered there, had been at the back of his
mind ever since he had recognised Marguerite. But
he intended not to listen to it, not to let it speak at all.
Somehow, her use of Paul’s name angered him extremely.
It dropped from her lips with so usual and
homely a sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt it was to save you. It would be!” he
said, sardonically. “Some decent excuse would be
needed even between you two when you sat together
alone through the long dark evenings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard meant to hurt, but Marguerite wore an armour
against him and his arrows were much too blunt
to pierce it. She had a purpose of her own to serve,
of which Gerard de Montignac knew nothing; she was
clutching at a desperate chance—if, indeed, so frail a
thing could be called a chance—not of merely saving
her lover’s life, but of so much more that she hardly
dared to think upon it. Her only weapon now and
for a long heart-breaking time to come, was patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are unjust,” she said, without any anger, and
without any appeal that he should reconsider his words.
Gerard suddenly remembered the last words that the
black-bearded Basha had spoken as he climbed onto his
mule.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all in God’s hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had spoken just in his tone. Argument
and prayer were of no value now. It was all written,
all fated. What would be, would be. Either Gerard
de Montignac would drop that revolver from his hand
and her desperate chance become a little less frail than
before, or he would not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was it that woman in the spangled skirt used
to say of you?” Gerard asked, with a seeming irrelevance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Henriette?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Henriette. You had a look of fate. Yes!
She was right, too. It was that look which set you
apart, more than your beauty. Indeed, you weren’t
beautiful then, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gazing at her moodily. The sharp anger
had become a sullenness. Marguerite had grown into
beauty since those days, but it was not the roseleaf
beauty born of days without anxiety and nights without
unrest. It was the beauty of one who is haunted
by the ghosts of dead dreams and who wakes in the
dark hours to weep very silently lest some one overhear.
Destined for greater sorrows or perhaps greater joys
than fall to the common lot! That was what Henriette
had meant! And looking at Marguerite, Gerard,
with a little ungenerous throb of pleasure, perceived
that at all events the greater joys, if ever they had
fallen to her, had faded away long since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These have been unhappy years for you, Marguerite,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For both of us,” she answered. “How could they
have been anything else? Paul had lost everything for
which he had striven, whilst I knew that it was I who
had caused his loss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he didn’t lose you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t have to strive for me,” Marguerite returned,
with just the hint of a smile and more than a
hint of pride. “I was his from his first call—no, even
before he called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard could not but remember the first meeting of
this tragic couple in the Villa Iris. Paul Ravenel had
stood behind Marguerite’s chair, and without a word,
without even turning her head to see who it was that
stood behind her, she had risen from the midst of the
Dagoes and Levantines, as at an order given. She had
fallen into step at his side, and no word had as yet
passed between them. Gerard de Montignac recollected
that, even then, a little pang of jealousy had stabbed
him and sharply enough to send him straight out of
the cabaret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes,” he said, slowly. “I had never
spoken to you then, had I? It wasn’t until afterwards
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He was thinking and drawing some
queer sort of balm from the thought, that Marguerite
had not so much flatly refused him his two days as set
her heart on Paul Ravenel before she had met him.
If it had been he, for instance, who had stood behind
Marguerite’s chair and silently called her! But, then,
he hadn’t. He had gone away and left the field clear
for Paul Ravenel. Other memories came back to him
to assuage his wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, it was I who brought you and Ravenel
together,” he said. “For it was I who persuaded him
to come with me on that first night to the Villa Iris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” Marguerite drew in her breath sharply.
“He told me that he almost didn’t come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would have been better if he had not come, if he
had stayed quietly in his house and gone on with his
report. So her judgment told her. But she could never
imagine those moments during which Paul had stood
in doubt, without picturing them so vividly that she
had a quiver of fear lest he should decide not to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was I, too, who sent Paul Ravenel to you at the
end,” Gerard de Montignac continued; and as Marguerite
drew her brows together in a wrinkle of perplexity,
“Yes,” he assured her. “The night after you
didn’t want to speak to me any more, I went back to
the Villa Iris to find you. Did you know that? Yes,
I was leaving the next morning with the advance guard
for Fez. I didn’t know what might happen on the
march. I wanted to make friends with you again, so
that if anything did happen to me, you wouldn’t have
any bitter memories of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a kind thought,” said Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kind to myself,” returned Gerard, with, for the
first time in this interview, the ghost of a smile. Yet
to Marguerite it was as the glimmer of dawn upon a
black night of sickness and pain. There was a hope,
then, that the revolver would be returned to its holster
with its remaining five cartridges still undischarged.
Gerard’s own memories were at work with him,
memories of a kindlier self, with enthusiasms and generous
thoughts; and they must be left to do their work.
There was little that she could say or do—and that
little not until his mood had changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t find you,” Gerard resumed. “You had
gone. Henriette told me how you had gone and why.
Yes, the whole horrible story of that old harridan and
the Greek! And you had dropped your bundle and
disappeared. And Henriette feared for you. I was
leaving at six in the morning; I was helpless. I went
on to Paul Ravenel and told him that he must find
you before any harm came to you. And he did, of
course. That’s clear. So I had my share in all this
dreadful business. Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, I hadn’t realised it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down on a chair by the table and stared at
its surface with his forehead puckered. But he still
held the butt of his revolver in his hand. If only he
would lay it down just for a moment! Marguerite
had a queer conviction that he would never take it up
again to use outside the window, once he let go of it.
But he did not let go. His fingers, indeed, tightened
upon the handle, and he cried: “I don’t know what to
do.” Neither did Marguerite. She could let Gerard
de Montignac remain in his error, or she could dispel
it. She was greatly tempted not to interfere. It was
a small matter, anyway. Only, small matters count so
much in great issues. Let the scales tremble, the
merest splinter will make one of them touch ground.
Marguerite trusted to some instinct which she could
not afterwards explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I am unwise,” she said. The note of hesitation,
for the first time audible, drew Gerard’s eyes
to her troubled face. “But I don’t know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
truth is you had no real share in our”—she paused for
a word which would neither blame nor excuse—“in
our disaster. The night I was turned out, Paul was
waiting for me in the garden. I didn’t expect him. I
was in despair. I dropped my bundle; and he rose up
out of the darkness in front of me. I loved him. It
was the wonderful thing come true. He took me away
to a house which he had got ready——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A house near to his on the sea-wall?” suddenly
exclaimed Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true, then. I saw his agent and him coming
out of it. I think that I told Henriette, never
dreaming that the house was meant for you, that you
were already in it when I told Henriette.” He looked
at Marguerite suddenly with eyes of pity. “You two
poor children!” he exclaimed, softly, and after a few
moments he added with a whimsical smile, “I told
Paul that he would break his leg when we, the less
serious ones, only barked our shins. It is a bad thing
not to walk in the crowd, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched her for a little while like a man in
doubt. Then he reached his arm out and tapped with
the muzzle of his revolver—for he still held it in his
hand—on the part of the table opposite to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must sit down and tell me exactly what happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite obeyed. She told Gerard of her journey
up from the coast to Fez when Paul was sure that the
road was safe, and how she came to the little palace
with the door upon the roofed alley which Paul had
got ready for her. Gerard, who had thought to listen
to her story without question or comment, could not
restrain an exclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were in Fez, then, all that year!” he said,
wondering. “In the house of Si Ahmed Driss! I
never dreamt of it. Even when I discovered it and
searched it, that never occurred to me. When I saw
you both here, I imagined that Paul had slipped away
at a bad moment for France, without a thought of his
duty, to join you at Mulai Idris in accordance with a
plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I was in the house at Fez. Later, on that
night of the sixteenth, he knew that the massacres were
certain. He went to headquarters with the information.
If they had listened to him then, he would never have
deserted at all. But they wouldn’t listen, and he had
to choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She described how on the next day the fanatics had
rushed in searching for a French officer who had been
seen once or twice to visit there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was not before that night, then, the night he
came to the headquarters, that he was sure?” Gerard
interrupted, quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They would have come to seek him in the house,
even if he had ridden straight back from the Hospital
Auvert to Dar-Debibagh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he did save your life by deserting,” said
Gerard. And, on the other hand, he asked himself was
there any duty not discharged because Paul did desert?
Was there any mistake made because the little Praslin
led Paul Ravenel’s company along the river bed instead
of Paul himself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, but it’s difficult!” cried Gerard. “Complexities
upon complexities! How shall one judge—unless”—and
he caught with relief at his good rules
and standards—“yes, unless one walks in the crowd.
It’s the only way to walk. Thou shalt do this! Thou
shalt not do that! All clear and ordered and written
in the book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard had gibed enough in his day at those innumerable
soldiers who answered every problem of
regulations and manœuvres immediately with a complacent
“It’s so laid down,” or “It’s not so laid down in
the book.” He was glad to get back in the windings
of this case to the broad highway of “the book.” The
book told him how to deal with Paul Ravenel. Well,
then!—&nbsp;Yet—yet——!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite watched his face cloud over, and hurriedly
continued her story, or rather began to continue
it. For at her first words as to how Paul had out-witted
the invaders of the house in Fez Gerard interrupted
her with a cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The uniform tunic, eh, Marguerite? The tunic all
hacked and battered with blood?” He uttered a little
wholesome laugh of appreciation. “And all prepared
in readiness the night before. Yes, I recognise Paul
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the third time that Gerard de Montignac
had spoken of “Paul” without any “Ravenel” added to
it to show that he and Paul were strangers. Marguerite,
you may be sure, had counted each one of
them with a little leap of the heart. “And the blood!”
he went on. “I think I know whence that came. His
arm, eh? Wasn’t it so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite had determined to use no tricks with
him, but she could not resist one now, the oldest and
simplest and the never-failing. She looked at Gerard
with awe and admiration—so sharp he was and penetrating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Oh, but how did you know? It’s rather
wonderful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When he was standing against the window there,
the sleeve of his djellaba fell back. There was a scar
like a white seam on his forearm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite breathed her wonder at this prodigy of
insight, and, like a good artist, having made her point,
she did not labour it. She related with what reluctance
Paul had afterwards told her the thing which he had
done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew nothing of it before. I thought that he was
on leave. I should have killed myself whilst there was
yet time for him to return to the camp if I had known.
Even when I did know, I hoped that he could make
some excuse, and I tried to kill myself. But he had,
of course, foreseen that, and prepared against it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had taken my little pistol secretly from the
drawer where I kept it. He did not give it me back
again until I promised that I would not use it unless
the Moors were on the stair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac started suddenly and pushed
his chair sharply back. Some quite new consideration
had flashed into his mind. He looked at Marguerite
with a sentence upon his lips. But he did not speak
it. He turned away and took a turn across the room
towards the window and back again, whilst Marguerite
waited with her heart in her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do?” he asked; and to Marguerite
the fact of his actually addressing the question to her
made the interview more of a nightmare than ever.
He was standing close to her (breaking the breech of
his revolver and snapping it to again, and almost unaware
of who she was, and quite unaware that with
each click and snap of the mechanism she could have
screamed aloud). “What am I to do, Marguerite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite mastered her failing nerves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those trenches outside Mulai Idris,” she said.
“They were dug to resist the Zemmour. The people
here might have used them against you but for Paul.
He warned the Basha that he couldn’t win, that he
would find you just and fair and careful of all his
rights. Do you believe that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard reflected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do,” he said, slowly. “After all, he charged
with Laguessière when Laguessière was put to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Charged with Laguessière?” repeated Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—in Fez—one afternoon during the revolt. He
had a great staff and used it—used it well. So much
of the old creed remained with him, at all events.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, thought Marguerite, there had been an afternoon
when Paul had been on edge and she had sent
him out. He had come back, appeased, and a new
man. The riddle of that change was now explained
to her. But she had no leisure to dwell upon the explanation.
Gerard had swung away again from her,
and was now standing close to the window looking out
across the chasm to the dark blue of the hill in the
shadow opposite. One little step would carry him on
to the balcony, and the butt of his revolver was still
in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me, Marguerite,” he said, in a low voice;
and suddenly he became, to her thought, more dangerous
in his calm than he had been in his anger.
“Here’s a law broken by you and Paul, and see what
misery has come of it! What loss! Shall I repair that
law by breaking another? Hardly! Look at me, Marguerite!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not look at her. He even advanced a
foot beyond the window-ledge so that the boards of the
balcony creaked and groaned beneath its pressure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could have lived in Paris with Deauville for the
summer and Monte Carlo for the winter, and my own
lands for the autumn—a pleasant, good life. I could
have lived with women about me—the fine flower of
them, the women who are exquisite and delicate. But I
didn’t. I left the enjoyments to the others. I came
out into these hot countries, the countries of squalor,
to serve France. And I have served; yes, by God, I
have served! That has been my creed. Shall I let
another spit on it, even though he was my greatest
friend? Not I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite gave all up for lost. The one chance at
the eleventh hour was not to be tried out by Paul and
her. Well—she was very tired. She closed her eyes
that she might not see anything of what happened at
the window—anything more in the world. If ever she
had worn the look of one set apart by fate, as so many
had declared, she wore it now, stamped upon the submission
of her face. Her hands went to her girdle and
felt within its folds; and that action saved her lover
and herself. For Gerard de Montignac saw it as he
was stepping out onto the boards of the balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait!” he cried, in a sharp, loud voice; and in a
moment he was standing in front of her with a look of
horror in his eyes. “The little pistol, which Paul took
away from you and gave you back only on your promise—where
is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite neither moved nor answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is there,” he cried, pointing to where her hand
rested within her belt. It was that bedrabbled woman
in the spangled skirt who had prophesied it. Henriette,
yes, Henriette! It was strange over how many years
that poor waif’s words had reached and with what
effect. “No!” he cried. “You must go your ways.
I’ll not have that upon my soul the day I die,” and he
turned from her and rushed from the room, and in a
few moments Marguerite heard the sound of a horse
galloping away down the cobbled street as though its
rider had no thought for his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac talked for many hours the
next day with the Basha in the house at the city’s
top. But neither he nor the Basha spoke once of Si
Tayeb Reha. They came to a good understanding, and
Gerard rode back to his camp, his work in Mulai Idris
done. He sat in his camp chair outside his tent that
night watching the few lights upon the hillside go out
one after the other and Mulai Idris glimmer, unsubstantial,
as the silver city of a dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard had carried off a small sort of triumph which
would mean many good marks in the books of his
great commander. But he was only thinking to-night
of the two outcasts in the house on the city wall.
Whither would they seek a refuge now that the gates
of Mulai Idris were to stand open to the world? And
was it worth their while? Marguerite’s haunted face
and Paul Ravenel burrowing deeper and deeper into
obscurity! Gerard turned to Laguessière, who was
smoking at his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walk in the crowd, my friend! It is always less
dangerous to walk in the crowd. Well, let us turn in,
for we start early to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the morning the tents were gone and Gerard’s
column was continuing its march through the Zarhoun.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch22'>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<h3>The Splendid Throw</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hat</span> had happened between the moment
when Gerard de Montignac rode away from
the door of Si Tayeb Reha’s house the first
time and the moment when the pistol-shot rang out?
It had all been Marguerite Lambert’s idea—a despairing
clutch at some faint and far-off possibility, hardly
a hope, yet worth putting to the proof. She had heard
every word which Gerard had spoken. She had seen
the revolver laid upon the table. She had seen even
more than that. For when Gerard had gone from the
room, Paul had taken the revolver at once in his hands.
It would be a very little while before the sergeant noticed
that Gerard’s revolver was missing from its
pouch. He had not even time to write more than one
“good-bye” to Marguerite. There were good friends
who would look after her—the Basha himself, Selim
his own servant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road to the coast passed across the plain below
the city, and there was a letter for her long since
written with his instructions, on the top of his desk.
He paused after he had written his one word to make
sure that he had forgotten nothing. The addresses of
his agents and his lawyers were written in the letter
and all that he had, his property in the English funds,
his houses in Fez and Casablanca, was bequeathed to
her in a will of which Mr. Ferguson had charge. No,
nothing had been forgotten—except that Marguerite
herself was watching him from behind the curtains.
She came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul handed to her the paper with the one word
“good-bye” written upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite, Gerard de Montignac has been here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. I heard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you understand, my dear. This is the end
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For both of us, then, Paul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to argue and stopped. The futility of his
words was too evident. She would follow him, whatever
he might say. He began to thank her for the
great love she had lavished on him and he stopped
again. “I could never tell you what you have meant to
me,” he said, helplessly. “But if it was all to do again,
I should do as I did. For nothing in the world would
I have left you alone through those days in the house
of Si Ahmed Driss. Only, it is a pity that it must all
end like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her in his arms and kissed her and put her
from him. “Will you leave me now, my dear? At
any moment the knock may come upon the door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that Marguerite’s inspiration came to
her. She besought him to hold his hand. She fetched
a rope and an axe. Often she had noticed from the
window that ledge of rock breaking the precipice below.
Paul was inclined to revolt against the trick
which she was asking him to play. It was not likely
to succeed with Gerard de Montignac. It would only
add one more touch of indignity to their deaths. But
Marguerite was urgent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not thinking of just saving our lives, Paul, so
that we may fly and hide ourselves again in some still
darker corner for a little while,” she said, eagerly. “I’ll
tell you of my hope, my plan, afterwards. Now we
must hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul doubled the rope over one of the iron stanchions
of the balcony close to the wall, whilst Marguerite
locked the door. He climbed over the rail, and, taking
a turn of the doubled rope round the upper part of his
right arm and another turn round his right thigh, he
let himself down until he hung below the balcony. He
kept his arms squared and his hands below the level
of his chin, and placing the flat of his feet against the
wall of the house, he was able, by slackening the coils
round arm and thigh, to descend without effort to the
ledge of rock, where he lay huddled in a counterfeit
of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move until you hear my voice calling to
you,” she whispered. Then she drew up the rope and
broke down the rail of the balcony with some blows
of the axe, and, unlocking the door, hid away both axe
and rope in another room. She came back swiftly, and
then, taking up the heavy revolver, fired it out of the
window and let it fall upon the boards of the balcony.
She dropped to her knees, and thus Gerard de Montignac
found her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through that scene, whilst life and death were in
the balance for these two, Paul Ravenel lay motionless
upon the ledge of rock below the city wall. He dared
not look up; he heard Gerard’s voice raised in anger
and scorn; he expected the shock of the bullet tearing
through his heart. But the voice diminished to a murmur.
Gerard had gone back into the room. Some
debate was in progress, and while it was in progress,
from this and that far quarter of the sky the vultures
gathered and wheeled above the precipice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while he heard Marguerite’s voice, and,
looking up, saw that she was letting down the rope
to him. She had tied knots in it at intervals to help
him in his ascent, and he clambered up to her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gerard has gone?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He will not come here again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he believed you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He left us in pity to live our lives out as best
we could,” said Marguerite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul nodded his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Others will be coming and going now,” he said.
“This city will become a show-place, very likely. We
can’t remain in Mulai Idris because of those others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And we can’t remain anywhere else because of
ourselves,” said Marguerite, quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul was not startled by the words. They were no
more than the echo of words which he had been trying
during this last half hour not to speak to himself.
They had built up with elaborate care a great pretence
of contentment, watching themselves so that there
might be no betrayal of the truth, watching each other
so that if the truth did at some unendurable moment
flash out, no heed should be taken of it; and hoping
even without any conviction that one day the contentment
would grow real. But all that patient edifice of
pretence was a crumble of dust now. The outer world
in the person of Gerard de Montignac in his uniform
had rushed in, with his hard logic, its scorn for duty
abandoned, its emblems of duty fulfilled; and there was
no more any peace for Paul Ravenel and Marguerite
Lambert. To live for thirty or forty years more as they
had been living! It was in both their thoughts that
it would have been better for Gerard de Montignac to
have done straightway what he threatened, and for
Marguerite to have followed her lover as she had determined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul sat down at the table with his eyes upon Marguerite.
She had some hope, some plan. So much
she had said. Was it, he wondered, the plan of which
he from time to time had dreamed, but for her sake
had never dared to speak? He waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a man, Paul,” she began, “oh, generous as
men should not be, but a man. And you sit here idle.
A great personage in Mulai Idris, no doubt. The
power behind the throne—the Basha’s throne!” The
hard words were spoken with a loving gentleness which
drew their sting. “A man must have endeavour—I
don’t say success—but endeavour of a kind, if only in
games. Otherwise what? He becomes a thing in carpet
slippers, old before his youth is spent, and this you
would dwindle, too, for me! No, my dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul made no gesture and uttered no word. She
was to speak her thought out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You laugh and joke with these people here. For
five minutes at a time no doubt you can forget,” she
continued. “But you can never exchange thoughts
with your equals, you can never talk over old dreams
you have had in common, old, hard, and tough experiences
which you have shared. And these things, Paul,
are all necessary for a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Paul Ravenel neither denied nor agreed. He
left to her the right of way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And in spite of all you still love me!” she cried, in
a sudden fervour, clasping her hands together upon
her breast. “Me whom you should hate. I clutch the
wonder of that to my heart. I must keep your love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no danger of your losing it, Marguerite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is—oh, not at once! But I am warned,
Paul. There’s the light showing on the reef. I keep
my course at more than my peril.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul went back upon his words and his looks. What
could he have said, he who so watched himself?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this warning?” he asked, with a smile, making
light of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We dare not quarrel,” she answered, slowly.
“That human natural thing is barred from us. The
sharp words flashing out, the shrug of impatience, the
few tears perhaps from me, the silent hour of sulkiness
in you, the making-up, the tenderness and remorse—these
things are for other lovers, Paul, never, my dear,
for you and me. We daren’t quarrel. We must watch
ourselves night and day lest we do! For if we did,
the unforgivable word might be spoken. I might fling
my debt to you in your face. I might be reminded of
it, anyway. No, we must live in a constraint. Other
lovers can quarrel and love no less. Not you and I—a
man who has given his honour and career, and a
woman who has taken them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument silenced Paul Ravenel, for there was
no disputing it. How daintily the pair of them had
minced amongst words! With what terror of a catastrophe
if the tongue slipped!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Marguerite, with a nod. “So! So,
Paul, let us stake all on one splendid throw! Go down
if we must, but if we do, in a fine endeavour, and perhaps,
after all, win out to the open street!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with a ring in her voice which Paul had
not heard for a long while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” he asked, and the light leaped in his eyes.
So much hung upon the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The French are recruiting Moorish soldiers——”
and she got no further, for Paul sprang up from his
chair, his face one flame of hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite!” he cried, in a thrilling voice, and
then sank down again with his face buried in his arms.
“Marguerite!” he whispered, and the tenderness and
gratitude with which the utterance of her name was
winged, she caught into her memories and treasured
there against the solitude which was to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved round the table and laid her hand upon
his bowed head and let it slip and rest upon his heaving
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So the thought has been in your mind too, Paul?”
she said, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And for a long time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you would not speak it. No! I must find
that way out for myself,” she said, gently chiding him,
“lest you should seem to wish at all costs to be rid of
me.” She walked away from his side and drew a
chair up to the table opposite to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us be practical,” she said, very wisely, though
her eyes danced. “It would be possible for you to
enlist without being recognised?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul lifted his head and nodded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over in the south by Marrakesch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you could continue to escape recognition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so. Even if I were recognised, very likely
those who recognised me would say nothing. I remember
a case once .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here?” cried Marguerite. “There was a case, then—an
example to follow—and even so you would not
tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean I know of a case here. I was thinking
of another country. India. If that man could, I
could, for I am even better equipped than he was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel could say that with confidence. He
knew more of the Moors, had more constantly lived
their life and spoken their dialects than Colonel Vanderfelt
had known of the Pathans upon the frontier
of India. The example of Colonel Vanderfelt had
been long in Paul Ravenel’s thoughts. How often had
he watched with an envy not to be described, both when
he waked and when he slept, that limping figure, with
the medals shining upon his breast, walk down the dark
city street from the brilliant lights of the Guildhall!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How often had this room in the remote hill town of
Mulai Idris been suddenly filled with the fragrance of
a Sussex garden, whilst he himself looked out not
upon the hillside of Zahoun but upon a dim and dewy
lawn where roses clustered! He had done the bad
thing which his father did, and, like his father, lost his
place in the world. Could he now win back that place
by the expiation of his father’s friend? Was it not of
excellent omen that the solution which he had remembered,
Marguerite had herself devised? But she must
weigh everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be long before opportunity comes,” he
warned her. “Such opportunity as will restore to me
my name. It may never come at all. Or death may
come with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite looked round the room and out of the
window to the barren hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is not this death, Paul?” she answered, simply, and
he was answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must make me a promise, too, before I go,
Marguerite,” he continued. “More than once you’ve
said you couldn’t go on living if .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite interrupted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I promise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great load was lifted from both of them. They
set straightway about their preparations. Marguerite
was to set out first with Selim and her women. The
road over the Red Hill to Tangier was no longer safe
at all, since it passed through a portion of the Spanish
zone. But five days of easy travel would take her to
Casablanca, through a country now peaceful as a road
in France. She would go to Marseilles, she said, and
wait there for news of Paul. They passed that evening
with a lightness of spirit which neither of them had
known since they had laughed and loved in the house of
Si Ahmed Driss before the massacres of Fez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one thing which troubles me,” said Paul,
catching her in his arms and speaking with a great
tenderness. “Long ago in Fez you once told me of a
girl who, when her husband died, dressed herself in
her wedding gown——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” said Marguerite, and laid her hand upon
his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You remember, then?” said Paul. He took her
hand gently away, and Marguerite bent her head down
and nodded. “ ‘I couldn’t do that, my dear,’ you said.
I have never forgotten it, Marguerite. I should have
dearly loved, if before we parted—that had been possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marguerite raised her face. There were tears in her
eyes, but her lips were smiling, and there was a smile,
too, in her eyes behind the tears.</p>

<p class='noindent'>She quoted with a laugh from the poet whose brown
books had been the backbone of their library, and then
drew his head down to hers and whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Paul. The world shall supply its glove—afterwards,
when you come back to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I don’t come back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then, my dear, since you have been the only
man for me, and I have been the only woman for you,
we must hope that the good God will make the best of
it.” She laughed again and her arms tightened about
his neck. “But come back to me, my dear!” she whispered.
“I am young, you know, Paul—twenty-three.
I shall have such a long time to wait if you don’t, now
that I have promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were ready within the twenty-four hours. The
tail of Gerard de Montignac’s column had hardly disappeared
before Marguerite, with her little escort, her
tents and camp outfit, rode out of the gate of Mulai
Idris and turned northwards past the columns of Volubilis.
Paul rode with her to the top of the breach in
the hills, whence the track zigzagged down to the plain
of the Sebou. There they took their leave of one another.
At each turn of the road Marguerite looked upwards
and saw her lover upon his horse, his blue cape
and white robes fluttering about him, outlined against
the sky. The tears were raining down her face now
which she had withheld so long as they were together,
and in her heart was one deep call to him: “Oh, come
back to me!” She looked up again and the breach in
the hills was empty. Her lover had gone.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch23'>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<h3>The Necessary Man</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>n</span> the summer of that same year, the thundercloud
burst over Europe, and France, at her moment of
need, reaped the fine harvest of her colonial policy.
Black men and brown mustered to the call of her bugle
as men having their share of France. Gerard de Montignac
scrambled like his brother officers to get to the
zone of battles. He was seconded in the autumn, was
promoted colonel a year later, and was then summoned
to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a little room upon the first floor in a building adjacent
to the War Office Gerard discovered Baumann,
of the Affaires Indigènes, but an uplifted Baumann, a
Baumann who had grown a little supercilious towards
colonels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, De Montignac!” he said, with a wave of the
hand. “I have been expecting you. Yes. Will you
sit down for a moment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard smiled and obeyed contentedly. There were
so many Baumanns about nowadays, and he never tired
of them. Baumann frowned portentously over some
papers on his desk for a few moments, and then, pushing
them aside, smoothed out his forehead with the
palm of his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours is a simpler affair, De Montignac. I am
happy to say,” he said, with a happy air of relief.
“The Governor-General is in Paris. You will see him
after this interview. He wants you again in Morocco.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is necessary?” Gerard asked, unwillingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a doubt of it, my dear fellow. You can take
that from me. The Governor-General is holding the
country with the merest handful of soldiers, and there
are—annoyances.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Serious ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very. Bartels, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bartels?” Gerard repeated. “I never heard of
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far away from the main shock of the battles, many
curious and romantic episodes were occurring, many
strange epics of prowess and adventure which will
never find a historian. Bartels was the hero of one,
and here in Baumann’s clipped phrases are the bare
bones of his exploit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was a non-commissioned officer in the German
army .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. enlisted on his discharge in our Foreign
Legion—was interned in August, 1914, and got away
to Melilla.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Spanish zone, on the coast. Yes,” said
Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was safe there and on the edge of the Riff
country. He got into touch with a more than usually
turbulent chieftain of those parts, Abd-el-Malek, and
also with a German official in Spain. From the German
officials Bartels received by obscure routes fifteen
thousand pounds a month in solid cash, minus, of
course, a certain attrition which the sum suffers on the
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With the fifteen thousand—call it twelve—with the
twelve thousand pounds a month actually received, and
Abd-el-Malek’s help, Bartels has built himself a walled
camp up in the hills close to the edge of the French
zone, where he maintains two thousand riflemen well
paid and well armed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard leaned forward quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely a protest has been made to Spain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you rush at things, my dear De Montignac!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be ‘Gerard’ in a moment,” De Montignac
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course a protest has been lodged. But Spain
renounces responsibility. The camp is in a part of the
country which she has officially declared to be not yet
subdued. On the other hand, it is in the Spanish zone—and
we have enough troubles upon our hands as it is,
eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That has always been our trouble, hasn’t it? The
unsubdued Spanish zone,” he said, moodily. “What
does Bartels do with his two thousand riflemen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He wages war. He comes across into French
Morocco, and raids and loots and burns and generally
plays the devil. And, mark you, he gets information;
he chooses his time cleverly. When we are just about
to embark fresh troops to France, that’s his favourite
moment. The troops have to be retained, rushed
quickly up country—and he, Bartels, is snugly back on
the Spanish side of the line and we can’t touch him.
Bartels, my dear De Montignac”—and here Baumann,
of the Affaires Indigènes, tapped the table impressively
with the butt of his pencil—“Bartels has got to be
dealt with.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Gerard replied. “But how, doesn’t seem
quite so obvious, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann gently flourished his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We leave that with every confidence to you, my
dear Colonel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard pushed his chair back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you do, do you! I don’t know that I’ve the
type of brain for that job,” he said, and thought disconsolately
how often he had jeered at the officers
who simply passed everything that wasn’t in “the
book.” He would very much have liked to take the
same line now. “How does this fellow Bartels get
his twelve thousand pounds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through Tetuan probably. We don’t quite know,”
said Baumann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And where exactly is his camp on the map?” Gerard
asked next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not sure. We can give you, of course, a
general idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have nobody amongst his two thousand men,
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a soul. So, you see, you have a clear
field.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I see that, and I need hardly say that I am
very grateful,” said De Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann was not quick to appreciate irony even in
its crudest form. He smiled as one accepting compliments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We do our best, my dear Gerard,” and Gerard
beamed with satisfaction. He had heard what he had
wanted to hear, and he would not spoil its flavour. He
rose at once and took up his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will go and see the Governor-General.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find him next door,” said Baumann. “We
keep him next door to us whilst he is in Paris, so far
as we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very wise,” said Gerard, gravely, and he
went next door, which was the War Office. There he
met his chief, who said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen Baumann? Good! Take a little
leave, but go as soon as you can. Ten days, eh? I
will see you in a fortnight at Rabat,” and the Governor-General
passed on to the Elysée.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac did not, however, take his ten
days. He knew his chief, a tall, preëminent man, both
in war and administration, who, with the utmost good-fellowship,
expected much of his officers. Gerard
spent one day in Paris and then travelled to Marseilles.
At Marseilles he had to wait two days, and visited in
consequence a hospital where a number of Moorish
soldiers lay wounded, men of all shades from the fair
Fasi to the coal-black negro from the south. Their
faces broke into smiles as Gerard exchanged a word or
a joke with them in their own dialects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped a little abruptly at the foot of one bed
in which the occupant lay asleep with—a not uncommon
sight in the ward—a brand-new <span class='it'>medaille militaire</span>
pinned upon the pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is badly hurt?” Gerard asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is recovering very well,” said the nurse who accompanied
him. “We expect to have him out of the
hospital in a fortnight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard remained for a moment or two looking at
the sleeper, and the nurse watched him curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will do him no harm if I wake him up,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard roused himself from an abstraction into
which he had fallen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he answered, with a laugh. “If I was a general,
I would say, yes. But sleep is a better medicine
than a crack with a mere colonel. What is his name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahmed Ben Larti,” said the nurse, and with a careless
“So?” Gerard de Montignac moved along to the
next bed. But before he passed out of the ward he
jerked his head towards the sleeper and asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will he be fit for service again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” she answered. “In a month, I should
think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard left the hospital, and the next morning was
back in Baumann’s office in Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found the man I want,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahmed Ben Larti. He is in hospital at Marseilles.
He has the <span class='it'>medaille militaire</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann shrugged his shoulders. “Who has it
not?” he seemed to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had better see the Governor-General,” said
Gerard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann became mysterious, as befitted a high officer
of Intelligence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Difficult, my young friend,” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excellent, Baumann, excellent,” interrupted Gerard,
with a chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann pouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t quite understand,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there’s no reason that you should,” Gerard answered,
politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baumann was not very pleased. It was his business
to do the mystifying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s practically impossible that you should see the
Governor-General again. He is so occupied,” he said,
firmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard got up from his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Baumann, wisely. “That is another
matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you don’t know,” exclaimed Gerard, standing
over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” answered Baumann, and it took Gerard the
rest of that day before he ran his chief to earth. Like
other busy men, the Governor-General had the necessary
time to give to necessary things, and in a spare
corner of the Colonial Office, he listened with some
astonishment, asked a few questions, and wrote a note
to the War Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This will get you what you want, De Montignac.
For the rest, I agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forty-eight hours later Gerard had a long interview
with Ahmed Ben Larti in a private ward to which the
Moor had been removed: and towards the end of the
interview, Ahmed Ben Larti made a suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it!” said Gerard enthusiastically. Then his
spirits dropped. “But we haven’t got any. No, we
haven’t got one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Governor-General,” the Moor suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll send him a telegram,” said Gerard de Montignac.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now this was in the spring of autumn, 1916, when
Bartels was in the full bloom of power. His camp
was full, for the danger was small, the pay high, and
the discipline easy. The Moor brought his horse and
his rifle, was paid so many dollars a day, and could go
home if the pay failed or his harvest called him. But
in the autumn Bartels in his turn began to suffer annoyance.
Thus, on one occasion a strange humming
filled the air, and a most alarming thing swooped out
of the sky with a roar and dropped a bomb in the middle
of the camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bartels ran out of his hut with an oath. “They’ve
located us at last,” he growled. Not one of his soldiers
had ever seen an aeroplane before, except perhaps
the man who was cowering down on the ground close
to him with every expression of terror. Bartels jerked
him up to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ahmed Ben Larti.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They make a great noise, but they hurt no one,”
Bartels declared. “Tell the others!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others were running for their lives to any sort
of shelter. For, indeed, this sort of thing was worse
than cannon. And unfortunately for Bartel’s encouragements,
the aeroplane was coming back. It dropped
its whole load of bombs in and around that camp,
breaching the walls and destroying the huts and causing
not a few casualties into the bargain. There was
an exodus of some size from that camp under cover of
the night, and Bartels the next morning thought it prudent
to move.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved westwards into the country of the
Braue’s, and there his second misfortune befell him.
His month’s instalment of money did not come to
hand. It should have travelled upon mules from
Tetuan, and a rumour spread that the English had got
hold of it. Nothing, of course, could be said; Bartels
had just to put up with the loss and see a still further
diminution of his army. Within a month the new
camp was raided by aeroplanes, and Bartels had to
move again. From a harrier of others he had sadly
fallen to being harried himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a traitor in the camp,” he said, and he consulted
Abd-el-Malek and stray German visitors from
Tetuan and Melilla. They suspected everybody who
went away before the raids and came back afterwards.
They never suspected men like Ahmed Ben Larti, who
was always present in the camp on these occasions of
danger, not overconspicuously present, but just noticeably
present, running for shelter, for instance, or discharging
his rifle at the aeroplane in a panic of terror.
Bartels, however, carried on with constantly diminishing
forces until the crops were ripening in the following
year. Then the aeroplanes dealt with him finally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wherever he pitched his camp, there very quickly
they found him out and burnt the crops for a mile
around. The villages would no longer supply him with
food; his army melted to a useless handful of men;
he became negligible, a bandit on the move. Ahmed
Ben Larti called off the little train of runners which
had passed in his messages to French agents in Tetuan,
and one dark evening slipped away himself. His work
was done, and almost immediately his luck gave out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A telegram reached Gerard de Montignac at Rabat
a week later from the French consul in Tetuan, which,
being decoded, read: “Larti brought in here this morning.
He was attacked two miles from here and left
for dead. Recovery doubtful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of Ahmed’s messengers had been lured into
a house in Tetuan, and upon him Larti’s final message
announcing the date of his own arrival had been discovered.
Further telegrams came to Rabat from Tetuan.
Larti had lost his left arm just below the shoulder,
and his condition was precarious. He began to
mend, however, in a week, but three months passed
before a French steamer brought to Casablanca a haggard
thin man in mufti with a sleeve pinned to his
breast, who had once been Captain Paul Ravenel of the
Tirailleurs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac met him on the quay and
walked up with him to the cantonment at Ain-Bourdja.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have got quarters for you here,” said Gerard.
“There’s nobody you know any longer here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes!” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can rig you out with a uniform. The General
will want to see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?” said Paul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that you have been on secret service the
whole time. The troubles at Fez were the opportunity
needed to make your disappearance natural.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul sat down on the camp bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was arranged in Paris before you went to
Bartels,” said Gerard. “Oh, by the way, I have something
of yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened a drawer of the one table in the tiny
matchboard room and, unfolding a cloth, handed to
Paul the row of medals which he had taken from Paul’s
tunic when he had searched the house of Si Ahmed
Driss in Fez.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul sat gazing at the medals for a long while with
his head bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have got another to add to these, you know—the
<span class='it'>medaille militaire</span>,” he said, with a laugh, and his voice
broke. “I shall turn woman if I hold them any
longer,” he cried, and, rising, he put them back in the
drawer. Gerard de Montignac turned to a window
which looked out across the plain of the Chaiouïa. He
pointed towards the northwest and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Years ago, Paul, you saved me from mutilation
and death over there. I forgot that in Mulai Idris, and
you didn’t remind me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, too, had forgotten it,” said Paul. He looked
about the cabin, he drew a long breath as though he
could hardly believe the fact that he was there. Then
he said abruptly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must send a telegram to Marseilles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gerard de Montignac stared at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marseilles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Marguerite has been living there all this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you were in hospital there, and no one visited
you, I know. The nurse told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paul Ravenel smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marguerite never knew I was there. I was always
afraid that she would come there by chance. Fortunately,
she was driving a car. I was just Ahmed Ben
Larti. The time had not come.” He looked at Gerard
and nodded his head. “But I can tell you it was difficult
not to send for her. There she was, just a few
streets and just a few house-walls between us. There
were sleepless nights, with the light shining down on
all those beds of wounded men when I could have
screamed for Marguerite aloud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sent off his telegram from the Cantonment Post
Office and then strolled into the town with Gerard de
Montignac. The Villa Iris was closed; Madame Delagrange
had vanished. Petras Tetarnis was no doubt
driving his Delaunay-Belleville through the streets of
Paris. Paul looked at his watch and put it back into
his pocket with impatience. It was out in the palm of
his hand again. He was counting the minutes until a
telegram could be delivered in Marseilles. He was
wondering whether she was already aware—as she had
been aware when he had stood behind her on the first
night that they met.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A fortnight later Mr. Ferguson, the lawyer, received
a telegram which put him into a fluster. He was an
old gentleman nowadays and liable to excitement. He
sent for his head clerk, not that pertinacious servant,
Mr. Gregory—he had long since gone into retirement—but
another, from whom Mr. Ferguson was not inclined
to stand any nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall want to-morrow all the necessary forms for
securing English nationality,” he said, “and please get
me Colonel Vanderfelt on the trunk line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk went out of the office. The old man sat
in a muse, looking out of the window upon the plane
trees in the Square. So here was Virginia Ravenel’s
son coming home, invalided, with a wife. How the
years did fly, to be sure! Yet though the plane trees
were a little dim to his eyes, he heard a voice, fresh as
the morning, through that dusty room, and saw the
Opera House at Covent Garden with people wearing
the strange dress of thirty years ago.</p>

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
